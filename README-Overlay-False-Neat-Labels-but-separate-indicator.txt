@mannequin you mentioned Loma's EMA's yesterday. Can you remind me what EMA's he uses?

I had to tweak the script to put "overlay = true" to stop the indicator appearing like RSI/AO on a separate panel 



Yeah, I make it false so the indicator name doesn't appear on the right-hand-side labels, a bit neater IMO (can maually drag it to the main chart and then pin-to-right-scale).

Ah got it thanks. I turned off price labels for my indicators so not too much of an issue for me.
