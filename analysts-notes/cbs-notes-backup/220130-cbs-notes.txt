*** General notes from Twitch streams

*** RSI div info 
Ideally, RSI divs will be clean and sharp (like a discernable harmonic)
- There is no such thing as hidden bullish divergence; anyone tells you this; block them
- Ignore Stoch RSI if divergence trader; too fast; trash
Coin had 20 candles for "bull div", he said slightly too far, a bit dodgy, not valid.
Coin had clear support zone (in these 20 candles) that had broken down
So coin has "dodgy" bullish div and a breakdown of support = not a bullish div
-
BTC example 210523
12H: potential bullish div forming
1D: ackward/invalid as not enough candles (only 4)
-
Huge sell off (210519) would expect to see some slow down in the selling via D1 rsi bullish div (they were not, so expect lower lows eventually)
-
Huge sell off (210519): On D1, can see ADA RSI has not fallen as much relative to other coins - would therefore expect more lows. But cannot short the lows, there is H4 supply so can look to short that.
-
How does RSI print bullish div? It's about how heavy PA has sold off. Look for a reduction of the selling pressure into the lows (LLs made with less strength).
-
A HTF RSI div completes; he'll just market buy (not set limits for a dip)
-
RSI div normally in extremes. If not in extremes, need more confluence. "incredible strenth by market essentially fake-breaks" or they are signs that we're eventually going to turn it around and sell-through".
-
He'll take a trade solely on a RSI div
-
HTF (eg: 3D) divs indicate trend reversals
LTF (eg: H4) divs are for bounces
--
His biggest overall PnL comes from H4 divs
-
RSI 50 level in HTF trending markets is a good entry level
-
If RSI is hovering below 50, expect bearish continuation
If RSI is hovering above 50, expect bullish continuation 
-
Can NEVER assume div will occur, must wait for lock in
H4 div should provide a reasonable bounce, don't need to immediately buy on candle close, let it play out a bit first.
-
RSI correcting while price holds is bullish

211123 daily update 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH8ATbPIDpo&t=2s
Alice H1: div even though mostly not in extreme
Alice H1: "cbs-LTF-rsi-div-not-in-extreme-X"
Alice H1: Again, LTF, less strict on div being in extreme
Alice H1: Div not in extreme shows weakness in trend, not a reversal but a possible relief bounce)
Sand m15: "a running div" with much more than 14 candles
Sand m15: "declining momentum and then correction"
Sand m15: zoom to m30 and it becomes a proper div
Sand m15: rsi "running div" peaks all lower than previous
Tower: regions of consolidation (all time frames) that results in favourable RSIs (all time frames) is very bullish 

--
In a STRONG market, there will be a bounce at the RSI 50 level. So if no bounce, then that market isn't strong

RSI wrap-around; curving just above 50 level and then back down again is bearish when price action does the same

!!!!!!!RSI: SR levels first, RSI second!!!!!!!
HIDDEN-DIVS: Total trash
HIDDEN-DIVS: All hidden divs do is put you on the wrong side of trending market

*** CBS personal info
***
He has very "clean" timeframes: 1M, 1W, 3D, 1D, 4H, 1H, 15m, 5m, 1m
-
He was a tick scalper
Only uses PA (not scalping now; swing trading); only cares about how much price has moved
https://coldbloodedtraders.com/
Renko
He was initially just a scalper (ETH scalping only for 12 months)
Scalping mindset too much; cannot leave PC; cannot switch off
PC
Switched to swing after became a dad
Scalpers use vLTF and play both sides of a range. Ranging environments best for scalpers. Trending markets are not good for scalpers (21006)
Renko is a "tick chart", based only on "dollar value moved", it's not based on time. TPO / MP is a "tick chart" too.
Sclping timeframes; whatever works best for you (1m, 3m, 5m, 10m, 12m, 15m, etc, etc).
-
What makes a bear market
Lose of MS on HTF is what CBS uses to determine bear market
On daily, need to close above 60k to take the key high
-
Don't need books, just watch CryptoCred on Youtube
On Chain Analysis are cunts
On chain analysis is dog shit (because they are always wrong; they were saying can never go below 50k (crashed to 30k))
On chain is just a fad like EW, divergence, Wycoff, PA/OB; now just on chain's turn to be the fad
He uses market structure (not PA with OBs)
He uses the candle closes to draw PA divs, not highs/lows (unlike Ducc)
-
Only indicators he uses are RSI and awesome indicator (see his renko charts).
-
He's joined Haven crypto group; $250 per month
- (210606 stream Awesome Indicator first 20 mins)
He uses Awesome Indicator as it is slower (34 period) whereas RSI is 14 period. Awesome is not as quick as RSI. So Awesome gives him a good idea of "slow down (in momentum) through a region". Awesome "cleaner in tracking over longer timeframes".
"You will see the divergence better on Renko and the Awesome Indicator will work well".
-
Divergence occurring below 70 is unusual and normally sign of market-wide selloff. Can say probability of this div being invalidated is high and trade it as such
-
RSI divs should play out in about 14 candles max
There is no minimum number of candles needed though for divs
But peaks shouldn't be too close together but no official minimum amount of candles
Div confimred when div occurs on peaks and then locked in when candle closes confirming "clean peaks"

Spot and "proper trades"
Getting in on retests are MEMES
Close above SR market enter a long
Close below SR market enter a short

Breakout trade
Enter 50% on close above level
Enter 50% on retest of level (better average entery) but may never get this retest
SL below the start of the impulse
(Impulse should MSB/pattern break and RSI good too (rsi div, 50 retest or break above 50))

"extension point" heading up to extreme to create 

He's not based in London
He's currently based in Cardiff

He used to have long hair

*** Alts v. Btc
ALT/USDT: need BTC to slowly go higher to do well
ALT/BTC: need BTC to go sideways a bit then up slowly

*** Coins
210519: Nasdaq QQQ:
1M bear div playing out to potentially correct
Only convirmed end May
Took 2-3 red months to play out
SPX & DOW not as bad; each leg up higher momentum
QQQ each leg up less momentum

210521 SRM / SOL: look for 4H bull divs

210523 balperp 
Looks at D1: "no Divs so I can't play anything on the daily"
Looks at H4: "Extends too far past these points here so no valid div present". It was an M structure (L, HL, LL) so final leg is HL to LL so not valid (even though the L to LL would be valid, cannot ignore the HL (middle point of the M))

linkperp 210523
Very simple, when link into D1 oversold RSI, good buy opportunity

210523: He really likes metals right now (gold / silver and palladium)
Metals are less volatile than crypto; perhaps easier to trade for newbies
1h47: Silver 6 year consolidation breakout to 1 year consolidation (weekly)... 50+ target
Platform he uses for traditionals: CMC & Sasko bank

210606: Different people have different criteria for what is a bull or bear market. He uses market structure, others will use MA (eg: 200ma)

210606: Symmetrical triangle will break more often in the direction of the trend. Downtrend = down, uptrend = up.

210606: "He thinks candle-stick patterns are horse-shit"

210606:
In a strong uptrend (bull), bad news will get shrugged off and good news will get a strong reaction
In a strong downtrend (bear), good news will get shrugged off and bad news will get a strong reaction

"Support is support UNTIL it's not." 
"Resistance is resistance UNTIL it's not."
Don't be afraid to take action incase it breaks; don't second guess it; take your precautionary action AFTER it fails
Wait until price moves away from demand / supply to enter (ie: make sure it has been established first)
Don't anticipate; wait for confirmation.

Trading Journal:
Use your own discord server as you can paste tradingview charts in there and easily keep notes (entry, SL, exit, emotional state etc).

Mental state: You can "work" trading 60 hours a week and lose $5000. Imagine working normal job 60 hours per week and paying your boss $5k for your hard work.

Don't care about today or this week. Care about where you are in 5 years.

He doesn't like holding any crypto in a downtrend (so he's not yield-farming right now, although he would like to be yield farming).

Renko needs a premium account on TradingView.

Marking a range, he marks with candle closes (made with renko or line charts)

SFP: SFP is just a sweep ("we've taken the highs but closed below == sweep)

CBS is regarded as a "professional trader" so he is allowed to trade on FTX (classification of pro).

"The awesome oscillator is interchangeable with RSI"

"Strength is the reclaiming of significant levels"

Renko for scalping (no time-frame) with divergences
Got to be more aggresive when scalping

For stocks, he looks to TP at HTF bearish divergence.

He doesn't use log charts, doesn't use open interest
He likes Wycoff as an underlying theory, not for signals

He tells people he is a "trader", but keeps it surface level.
Doesn't say he spends 8 hours a day looking for divergences to position into futures contracts.
But even his close friends don't know that he's CBS (his wife does).

Never FOMO into news related pumps; they retrace quickly.

The Haven Notes CBS:
We use Awesome and not RSI with Renko
Traditional brick size 300 for BTC

He sorts watchlist by percentage change to get big movers

A, B, C, D grade trades:
A grade: HTF RSI div into HTF support + AO confluence 
D grade: retest of support

RSI momentum plays are what he did as a scalper
Comfortable being underwater & knowing not instantly in profit.
If scalper, you want to be instantly in profit or you need to get out of trade.
Swing trading needs more patience than scalping.
Swing trading needs less time at PC than scalping
Swing trades should last days to months
Swing trading crypto is tough (see EGLD). Best to use spot
Binance and FTX allow spot shorting (margin)

AO is slower so a bit more reliable in div printing, but since slower, may miss some divs
RSI is faster than AO

Crazy auction: PEGS NTF Matt Fury one on one collectibles. He's the creator of Pepe the Frog

When market is dumping, check 15m chart. Are bullish divs getting nuked? Don't try and long if they are!
Eg: clear bullish div (3x) normally free money... don't stand in the way of the market when it's like this. Don't long.

If a breakdown is happening on HTF, we can spot it coming on LTF

Be wary of longing diagonal breakouts straight into horizontal resistance

RSI rotation to the upside (from oversold to overbought)
RSI rotation to the downside (from overbought to oversold)

After large impulse (eg: down), it takes time for whales to exit positions (iceberg orders at support) so it will chop / range for a bit as they do this.
Also, other whales will start buying in order to build long position at support (iceberg orders)
Retail are expecting huge recovery of impulse and will get rinsed / chopped up as their emotions are heightened and discord / CT / telegram is blowing up 

If coin is straight chadding / trending, bear divs in extremes won't work. Must have context with PA

Use RSI to TP on spot
RSI W1 & D3: how much upside left until overbought?

RSI resetting after a pump:
A choppy region (range, chop-acc-up, chop-acc-down) will be needed to reset the RSI (come from overbought to 50 level) 

He used to use StochRSI, helps with timing, doesn't use anymore

Introduction to Divergences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR1slopvFoQ
He doesn't like hidden divs
- they tend to mask proper divs when trading into them
- wrong side of trade
- against the momentum actually coming through
Indication to market changing, momentum change
LOCKED IN: twin peaks (rsi bearish div)
LOCKED IN: rsi rise, peak, fall, rise, lower peak, FALL
LOCKED IN: two DISTINCT peaks on candle close = LOCKED IN
ENTRY: take 50% position on candle lock-in
ENTRY: next 50% of position on move out of extreme
ENTRY: entry positions like this as may be triple-drive (3x) and we're countering the trend (like harmonics)
When can we say the div has played out?
PLAYED-OUT: End to end plays (extreme to extreme)
PLAYED-OUT: Bear div candles will have PA lows, close when these taken
PLAYED-OUT: Close on a significant move in our favour (big candle, especially if this takes out bear div candle lows
PLAYED-OUT: Close if cross from below to above 50 level
PLAYED-OUT: Apply these closing strategies to time-frames <D3
PLAYED-OUT: HTF (D3, W, M) divs indicate full trend reversals and will have much further targets to aim for
SMALL-RSI-GAPS are POOR divs (tight divs are ineffective)
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: check lower time-frames for proper div
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: if tight RSI on H1, try 15m for proper div and trade as 15m setup (ie: a quicker more aggressive setup than H1)
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: want approx 9,10,11,12,13,14 candles for divs
LONG-DIVS-3X: if long triple div, check a higher time-frame
LONG-DIVS-3X: proper div setup (2 peaks) should be there
LONG-DIVS-3X: long triple div on 15m? check H1 and adjust trade accordingly
LONG-DIVS-3X: want approx 9,10,11,12,13,14 candles for divs
Many retail "need" to be in a position so MMs just need

Context. Wait (patience) for lock-in. Don't mess with RSI unless in extremes (exception uber trends)

Momentum with RSI video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AECBV8y0prc
- RSI is a measure of MOMENTUM (remember this)
- These RSI plays can be implemented on any time-frame
BREAK-50: Above 50 = bullish
BREAK-50: Below 50 = bearish
BREAK-50: Breaking through 50 level is SIGNIFICANT achievement for momentum; trade with the momentum (& trend)
BREAK-50: The 50-level decides who is winning the market tug-of-war (bulls or bears)
SR-50: HTF *trending* market, expect 50 to act as retest support. 50 level will not be support in ranging market
SR-50: We're looking for clear trending environments for 50 retests (good for trend joining (get in on HL) or keeping positions open)
MSB&50-CROSS: Break MS & break RSI 50 = new trend
MSB&50-CROSS: HTF trening market (eg: D1)
MSB&50-CROSS: Break MS (eg: HH) and RSI breaks above 50 = bullish momentum
MSB&50-CROSS: Instead of a MSB, it could be a pattern (diagonal / channel / etc) with rsi crossing above 50
SR-50: If downtrend, 50-level will act as resistace from below.
SR-50: If uptrend, 50-level will act as support from above.
SR-50: A lot of CBS trades is ANTICIPATING RSI breaking through the 50-level (confluent with a S/R level (MSB) too)
SR-50: Like MAs when the trend is too strong (won't touch the MA; it'll front run it) RSI will also front-run the 50-level if the trend is too strong
50&MA-GAPS: RSI monitors momentum in trending markets (like moving averages gaps)
50&MA-GAPS: MA big gap = strong trend (HH & HL)
50&MA-GAPS: MA compression = potential trend reversal
50&MA-GAPS: Bounce off 50 = momentum still strong (HH, HL)
50&MA-GAPS: Lose 50 level after a holding a long time significant (especially with bearish MSB too)
EXTREMES: Look at historical amount of time in overbought and oversold to gauge momentum of coin

LTF tips and tricks scalping video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYLACPfqx7s&t=103s

Big breakthrough for him was completely FLUID position building (not all in on one entry (eg: 2x div), instead start build entry but allow the possibility of 3x div).

FLUID position building changes MINDSET from defensive / negative to aggressive / positive (AGGRESIVE POSITION BUILDING)

Most people intra-day trading use 5m charts
Div still valid? Don't worry about time. Build FLUID position
Div not valid anymore? Close position
Build FLUID position without worrying about time.

Diagonal breakouts
Need BULLISH MS (uptrend)to play bullish breakouts
Need BEARISH MS (downtrend)to play bearish breakouts

Usually after a big impulse from a div, it will consolidate for a while (not impulse straight back in a V recovery). You will have time, don't rush.

ALICE & AXS tend to CONSOLIDATE then pop. If you see consolidation, watch for the pop.

Playing Divergences - TA Help with FTX (not from The Haven)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QUsgSZneY
RANGES: Playing divs within ranges is great
RANGES: Bear div into range-high / resistance, great
RSI-WEAK: Appreciate market conditions (eg: impulse BO of 2 month consolidation range into a large uptrend, don't short bear divs, try and get in on HLs of the new uptrend)
RSI-WEAK: flip the logic, look for bullish divergences
RSI-WEAK: If market strongly up-trending or down-trending don't use rsi divs, they are weak and it's what gives rsi a bad name (rsi meme)
MORE-14-CANDLES: huge ETH uptrend and bearish divs... continuous price HHs & continous rsi LHs gives one huge bear div much more than 14 candles (not good though as ETH is trending up hard and divs no use in massive trending markets)

RSI - How I use it & Advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dbRcZh_AHY&t=92s
Momentum indicator
- BO opportunities
- join in on the trend
- divs aligned with macro trend stronger
- counter trend div be more aggressive with TPs
14-CANDLES: If number of candles creating div exceeds 14 then it's not valid.
14-CANDLES: He doesn't completely stick to this rule but very good guidance for him
50-LEVEL: 50-level is a reset button for rsi (fresh start)
50-LEVEL: retest, cool off from or join existing trend
50-LEVEL: tells us (1) price cooled from strong trend an 50 point is natural resting place OR it's telling you price is ranging
50-LEVEL: CBS likes H4 best for analysing cooling off periods
50-LEVEL: Strong uptrend then cool off into extreme oversold then he's interested, then seeing cross above 50 very interested
50-LEVEL: he doesn't want to mess with asset chopping around 50 as this indicates indecision
MEME: "divergences can't be trusted in the trend"
MEME: need to use RSI in context with PA


=======
RSI Summary
=======
1. RANGING: Divs (~14 candles max, extremes, lock-in)
2. TRENDING: Retest of 50 level in strong TRENDING markets
3. BREAKOUT: 50 level cross with MSB / pattern-BO (momentum, new trend)
(build FLUID positions)

211026: his wife doesn't work and he's in his early 30s
Whales don't really do TA, it's psycology and timing the trend (trendlines)
His one-to-one lessons want to grow account NEXT WEEK, not SIX MONTHS time; sense of time huge time.
He's 30% in stablecoins right now
DefiGod approach is 2x on shitcoin then rotate to main ecosystem coin
3D rsi has room to expand
When everything looks good can be warning sign
-If everthing bullish and HTF RSI extended, watch out
-Check HTF to see if room for RSI to grow (D3 & W1 room to grow, D1 reset, then good for spot swing trade)
NFTs dead right now, he's in NFT hibernation, crypto market looks good for swinging now
CBS doesn't talk about tax tips
Finish up: 
MAIN THINK: DON'T OVER-COMPLICATE THIS PROCESS
DON'T THINK TOO DEEP INTO THE CHARTS (just look for pullbacks / retests)
WE KNOW AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO BE A LARGE SELL OFF
HAVE CAPITAL READY TO DEPLOY FOR THIS

--CBS Chilling 211108
His biggest breakthrough in trading was just trusting the trend (momentum) and not overcomplicating things
-
His spot portfolio big potential with a bigger portion of his portfolio (5% to 10%)
BIG POSITION: weekly divs (very rare - alchamix)
BIG POSITION: weekly rsi reset with retest of support
-
He doesn't use Fibs, doesn't like them, complicate things
Use HTF (minimum D3 for HTF) divs for taking profit in price discovery, not Fibs
His style is simple. RSI & horizontal-SR levels
RSI gives him momentum in his favour and lets market carry him
His horizontal-SR levels are technically "supply and demand zones"
His method works on legacy (stonks) very well, even easier
RSI reset is about 50 (perhaps down to 45ish OK)
Some ALTs will reset at specific levels not necessarily 50
-
High APY pools CBS is in: OHM, Climber, TIME, SPELL
OHM looks most promising
Spell & Ice he really believes in (cross-chain / bridges all in 1 solution from single source)
Spell & Ice has great community / cult, very important in crypto
Speel is "going after MKR Maker"
-
Swing trader needs patience, comfy underwater
Scalper needs market to move immediately (tiny SL)
-
Can never confirm a double top until it starts to move away from it (locks in)
Always look at the market from a bullish perspective
Where can I buy to make money
-
The longer the consolidation, the bigger the breakout
-
Use RSI to TP on spot
RSI W1 & D3: how much upside left until overbought?
-
Farming pool 14 days month ago everything just ticking over
All his farms reached full rewards now
-
Adam Lambert:
?"I am really interested in the farming [STAKING] stuff, but worry that my portfolio is too small for it to be worthwhile... and there are better ops elsewhere to grow it"
CBS:
Yes, 100%, better ops elsewhere
Need >100k to farm these "soft" investment, keep money just ticking over
If want to grow your portfolio, play the market, rotate through the ecosystems, play for the airdrops using alts
-
He's 9x up on his FTX degen account
-
The market is easyish (bullish) right now.
Psycology is the hardest part.
All the setups we've been looking at are simple:
RSI 50 touches or SR flips and you BUY
Don't worry about learning TA in a bull market; keep it very simple. Learn TA in a bear market.
Bear market PA is slower, more chop.
Bull market PA is aggressive and violent.
Plenty of opportunity all over
CBS taking heavy profit on ETH at 5k
OK if it pumps further, have to realise profit then rotate into other oppertunities
A big of it is NOT looking at your spot / hodl
-
Degen
One wrong mistake on 20x lev whole portfolio and fcukd
Good to go heavy on a couple of coins (conviction) rather than spread yourself 10% into 10 diff coins
-
Keep your spot on ledger as it makes it hard to panic sell

cbs-Bull-Market-Up-trending-Tips-and-Advice-notPussyBitch
Ignore twitter and discord (& telegram)
Use HTF charts, mark out significant levels (everything else LTF chop in a bull market)
Red day: You look at how far it can go down
Green day: You look at how far it can go up
HTF levels are the most important levels we have
Just give it a chance to go up and it will
Dictate by HTF levels, not H4 / 15m charts
Don't think reasons why bull market must end
TP, making good money USD on the move after 1 month
It COULD go higher
But there is opportunity EVERYWHERE
TPing doesn't mean you're frozen out of the market
BULL MARKET: Don't let your emotion lead you
BULL MARKET: Don't dive into the LTF charts

CHOP: After an impulse move, there is chop for a while.
CHOP: Don't over analyse; step away from the charts
CHOP: You'll lose the most money in the chop
TREND: D1 and higher is HTF for CBS
TREND: Use line chart
STABLE: He uses USDC, he doesn't use USDT (currenly 45% stable, 55% crypto)
STABLE: No liquidity issue with USDC 
STYLE: He's a momentum swing trader
STYLE: tries to anticipate when the momentum is coming (turning around or breaking out)
When a consolidation comes to an end, when bullish / bearish momentum is going to take over
He's not an order-block trader, he uses supply and demand regions which are very similar to OBs (doesn't classify himself an OB trader)
FARMS: Doesn't touch them, they're earning
FARMS: OHM, earning 6% every 5 days, can withstand drawdown
Productive asset, so more grace, a little bit of protection
FARMS: High APY farms (ponzinomics) tend to nuke..
FARMS: why not OHM & TIME?..
FAMRS: ..single side stake protocols, huge volume, different model to rest
FARMS: Normally, high APY farms dual pair (LPs) open to price swings, IL (impermenant loss)
FARMS: Single side staking is much more comfortable
FARMS: OHM is where CBS filters his higher risk staking profits to 
FARMS: OHM & TIME are blue-chip original forks, best to keep adding to the blue-chips
PSYCH: Figure out what is worst case sell off that is very aggresive and goes to a lower level than most think possible, especially when there is a HTF (weekly) div on the token
PSYCH: If planned for this in advance (W1 bearish divs can give very strong reactions), can then buy with a plan

Twitch midweek stream 211118:
He's NOT based in London
TRADER: He uses discord for journaling his trades, btc, eth, alts, htf, ltf, scalps
TRADER: Hodlers are better off sticking to spot after success, you're not a trader, you're an investor in a speculative market
TRADER: D1, D3 & W1 are his most used levels (as a momentum swing trader)
TRADER: Emotion control is way more important than TA; you need to be able to "pull the trigger"
KNIFE: Likes to buy into strength (will wait to buy high on SR reclaim & good RSI)
KNIFE: Doesn't like to knife catch (demand zones?)
KNIFE: Doesn't like to buy into weakness (demand zones?)
BTC-SHORTING: He doesn't short BTC, if BTC going down, alts will go down more, so short alts
BTC-SHORTING: He will take a large short position so he is *net short* on his spot portfolio (25min)
BTC-SHORTING: "Going to hedge a % of the portfolio against this AXS short trade"
BTC-SHORTING: close down some of the spot exposure too
BTC-SHORTING: Net short so he can get out of awkward positions
BTC-SHORTING: Little trimming of positions and hedge short to manage portfolio
TRADER: He *would not* just blindly buy support (eg: weekly demand); need a div with it
TRADER: Been trading full time for 4 years, only indicator he needs is RSI; need to backtest in order fully understand
TRADER: Never fail to TP into HTF resistance; there will be another play if it goes higher
TRADER: Management of emotions, especially when you have great entry, is very difficult (to take profit)


== Twitch stream 211124
D3 timeframe is great intersection between the daily and the weekly; very good for swing trades
Cooling off of RSI (ready for another leg up; like HL HH structure, this is a ROTATION up)
Watch what pumps on big green days: L1S, L1-ats, NFT gaming, metaverse (don't say "it didn't pump much so it will soon")
Analysis and charting knowledge can be a curse; analysis paralysis. Just press the green button and go away, tokens going up 40% a day. Fomo is sometimes a good feeling to follow
TOWER only game with millions of downloads yet has a low market cap; CBS aiming for another 10x ($1)
Gaia & Atlas possible new games to look at.
Compounding swings; don't fomo as it ruins average entry, wait for retest/strength of key level (SR)

His favorite plays are HTF divs
Trading is like gambling; addictive
Especially LTF, scalping, worry about missing out on impulses as you may only get one a day (and if you miss it you'll assume that you would have played it perfectly (and you wouldn't))
Swing trading is healthier for him, gives him breaks
It got to the point where he couldn't even enjoy video games (he oves video games) all his time was taken reading charts
There is always something giving great opportunity, don't rush it.
Manage risk; don't over-leverage (check charts too much).
Slow and steady; money begets money. How efficiently are you spending time? Treat it like a job

He was an "educator" before he became a full time trader
He uses SL on his spot
HTF divs are his exit signals for price discovery
He is a boomer
OHM is a super long term play
Atom long term play with ? on it
1. eth, 2. matic

-- Twitch 211130
He never has BTC spot holdings
RSI HH, HL, HH, HL curl up == "rotation back to upside"
Check weekly to see if run ups have finished (over extended)
Compare coins on the weekly to see which have still got gas in the tank
--
RSI has "room to expand to the upside"
--
If token is trending strongly, then 1st areas of demand should be bases for further pushes
BREAK-BEAR-DIV: Unusual place to confirm bear div (1st peak in overbought, second not in extreme)..
BREAK-BEAR-DIV: .. results in steep bear div angle..
BREAK-BEAR-DIV: ...quite a lot of candles between peaks
BREAK-BEAR-DIV: ..the push up is coming, expect momentum to carry on

"Awesome Oscillator By Bill Williams - Best Strategy Guide"
SF research AO by 
AO crossing the 0 line == RSI crossing 50 level
AO div lock-in (bar color change) == RSI lock-in
AO reset 0 line == RSI 50 reset
AO also has saucer strategy (enter after momentum pullback)
SAUCER STRAT: bars above zero, bars mostly green
SAUCER STRAT: at least 2 red bars (could be >2)
SAUCER STRAT: enter on confirmation of next green bar
SAUCER STRAT: catching the retest of a trending coin

"Awesome Oscillator Introduction and Overview" by CBS
AO: Momentum indicator
AO: Slower than RSI 
AO: Not as quick to deliver xovers or divs as RSI..
AO: ..but is usually MORE ACCURATE than RSI  
AO: Difference between 34MA & 5MA; plots the difference

XOVER: above0=bullish, below0=bearish
XOVER: As AO is slower than RSI, xovers are significant
XOVER: Just longing a cross over above 0 gives..
XOVER: ..good entry to trending markets
DIVS: use AO peaks just like RSI line for divs
DIVS: use lower AO PEAKS (bull div)
DIVS: use 2 bars of opposite colour (green) to confirm PEAKS
DIVS: (peak extreme can be one or more bars (red))
DIVS: (div locked-in after 2 bars of opposite colour (green))
DIVS: 2 bars for lock-in as it's difficult to reverse from
DIVS: Can start building position on 2nd color bar confirmed
POSITION: AO is a slow indicator, takes its time

SWING: CBS highly recommends, lots of info presented simply
SWING: Playing HTF divs was how he started developing..
SWING: ..a swing trading appetite and process
SWING: HTF divs on AO are "wonderful signals"
--
(i) macro trend: look back, mostly above or below 0 line?
(ii) xovers
(iii) divs

-- Krillin info on AO (members-questions 211218)
My take as an MA trader is that AO divergences are simply another way to read MAs flattening without displaying MAs on your chart
AO is the simply the gap between MA5 and MA34
MA34 on 12h is 4h MA100 and on daily that 4h MA200
Since I like MA100 a lot more than MA200 i'd naturally prefer 12h divergences

Daily update 211217
Swing spot, better to swing coin that'll be in price discovery on a 30% move up than a coin that'll be hitting major resistance on a 30% move up

Full Member Question Video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RTlkjElA04
RSI50: "cbs-rsi-50-level-bounces-and-PA-bounces.png"
RSI50: 50 level is not exact, it's a rough level
RSI50: 50 level should be used WITH PA together
RSI50: a PA triangle is CONSOLIDATION area
RSI50: The reason RSI is above the 50 is PA is trending up, but cool off of uptrend  ("dump" or consolidation) resets RSI
RSI50: Look for impulse breaking pa consolidation AND RSI breaking above or bouncing off 50 for uptrend continuation
RSI50: Result = PA impulse WITH momentum on it's side going WITH the trend
RSI-SR: "cbs-take-profit-using-momentum1.png"
RSI-SR: "How to use RSI with support and resistance"
RSI-SR: Combo of 50 level and DIAGONALS (diagonal = selloff or dump)
RSI-SR: "important PA event with an important RSI event" means a good signal IF we're at PA SR level; double confluence
RSI-SR: When looking for breakouts, RSI 50 level most important as gives biggest liklihood of most value (ride it to overbought)
FOLIO: Min stable he'll go to is 20% of portfolio, he'll never have a lower percentage of stable than this 
FOLIO: Min 20% stable, not to be a buyer, but so he's not fully invested in ponzi (crypto) tokens
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: He doesn't have stops on small COSMOS ecosystem coins, SCRT, SIENNA, etc, these can go up and down 30% a day, MUCH SMALLER POSITION SIZE, try and get xMultiple returns, don't worry about invalidation on these plays, his invalidation is COSMOS dieing, he's playing COSMOS for the future
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: He waited 3 months to be up 60% on COSMOS, now everyone is asking about his invalidation
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: Need to have a dollar amount willing to lose and multiple hoping to gain (this is the risk management for alt plays)
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: All questions about fear, invalidation levels of COSMOS, not one question about upside targets on the strongest ecosystem from the lows; overexposed=FEAR
HIDDEN: Hidden divs are absolute bollocks
HIDDEN: They are the worst because you'll very often go against a very strong move in the other direction and wreck you (see March 2021 example, both hidden bull div and normal bear div)
BO: You have to be a market-buyer when playing a breakout (not a limit buyer) 
BO: Market buyer 100% or 50% now and 50% lower down (retest)
BO: SL has to be below the impulse candle
SL-MOMENTUM: Always a tight stop with RSI breakout plays
SL-MOMENTUM: Clear invalidations (LL invalidates)
SL-MOMENTUM: Playing into momentum / impulse
SL-MOMENTUM: Timeframes of his official trades are H1, or lower, H4 at most - timing the market to go up right now, so need very tight SL
SL-MOMENTUM: H1, want in the 2, 3 or 4 hours
SL-MOMENTUM: Using 50 cross, AO cross, impulse now or I'm
SL-MOMENTUM: Really just about RSI 50 cross (or AO cross); NOT about the PA horizontal levels
COSMOS: Don't stake on Keplr (21 day bonding), stake in Osmosis pools (1 day bonding, same APR)
COSMOS: Posted a monthly chart, ask him in 3 to 6 months (time needed to for monthly chart play out)

===== Hedging
"cbs-luna-short-hedge-rsi-analysis1-hedge-all-spot-positions.JPG"
DOMINOES: RSI falling dominoes; chain reaction
DOMINOES: H4 low but not in oversold
DOMINOES: H12 rotating below the 50
DOMINOES: D1 peeking below the 50
DOMINOES: D3 above the 50 but pointing down
DOMINOES: W1 above the 50 but pointing down
DOMINOES: Because H4, H12, D1 have bad RSI, we expect them to drag D3 and W1 below the 50 too (not bounce at 50)
If you can get your short hedges (luna) outperforming your spot holdings this is very good in a down-market
--
Hedge all or a good portion of spot positions with an alt (or two) that looks bad;
hopefully the bad looking alts dump as much (or more) than our spot positions
--
$10000 of spot holdings
$10000 short position on luna

LONGS: AO is showing reducing momentum in grinds up
TARGET: aim for fresh lows (take previous low then new low)
POWER: All the power comes from the trending down direction
POWER: Slow grind up then quick impulse down
EARLY: Don't close trade early
EARLY: Don't worry about the slow grind back up eating your profits, let the market work for you, don't over-trade
SCANNING: Look weekly RSI, which coin is at the highest level
SCANNING: These coins have the furthest to fall
SCANNING: RSI bearish falling dominoes (chain reaction)
SCANNING: Which coin has furthest to fall
SCANNING: Luna is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Atom is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Crv is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Bnb is a catostophy chart (tipping point, lowest RSI in 2 years)
SCANNING: Near is a catostophy chart
