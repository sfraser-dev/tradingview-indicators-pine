"RSI - How I use it & Advice"

RSI is momentum indicator

He uses closes on PA for marking trendline

RSI
- Use for divergences
- Breakout opportunities
- Joining in on the trend

MACRO TREND
- Divergence WITH the macro trend much stronger
(eg: strong macro uptrend; bullish divergence stronger)
- Counter-trend divs DON'T hold too long (aggresive TP); don't 't look to hodl them

FOUR DIVERGENCE RULES
1:- Occur in an extension area (overbought / oversold)
2:- If diveregence extends MORE than 14 candles (roughly) it becomes INVALIDATED
3:- Two CLEAN peaks that occur above 50 line in a SHORT space of time (happens quickly)
4:- 50 point on RSI is a RESET point

JOINING THE TREND
The 50/midpoint point is a point where a trend will backtest as it cools off for a bit
EG: strong downtrend, PA will "cool off" and the RSI will go to the midpoint; this is a good point to get in and join the trend in motion (downtrend)
CBS uses the H4 most for finding cooling off periods (extremes of overbought & oversold on H4; the midpoint for higher timeframes)

"Playing Divergences - TA Help with FTX"
WITH MARKET STRUCTURE DEMAND / SUPPLY ZONES
1:- Bearish divergence that is occuring underneath a supply zone; divergence into resistance
2:- Happening in the oversold area (*highly* unusual to see valid divergence occur outwith the extremes (*might* occur in a very strong trending market))
3:- Divs should be super clear & obvious
4:- Divs should not extend past the length of RSI (14 candles)
5: Confluence needed: (i) div, (ii) extreme & (iii) SR level
6: Market conditions: RSI divs into SR is great in RANGES, not in strong trends (strong breakout from long-term range not good to play bearish divs that will occur in overbought)

"Indicator Discussion (relaxed) - TA Help with FTX"
Cuban indicators he uses with Renko for scalping
He uses RSI
He sometimes uses Stoch RSI (perhaps for his scalping because quicker)
He uses awesome indicator
-
RSI GREAT for ranging environemnts, not good to use solely RSI at all for trending environments UNLESS higher time-frame (such as weekly).
RSI divergences great for scalping too.
15m chart: RSI divs, RSI 50 crosses (bull/bear), RSI extremes
BACKTEST using the replay indicator; don't be lazy!
