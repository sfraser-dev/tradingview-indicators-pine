Introduction to NFTs #1

MetaMask is a MUST

can get a collection with 10,000 NFTs
can get one to ones (only a single piece of art)
floor price is the cheapest you can buy one of the NFTs for

Where to buy:
1. Actual website of NFT creator
2. Opensea.io (main NFT trading site)
3. Superrare.com (1-to-1s)
4. Foundation.app (1-to-1s)

Types of NFTs:
1. Minting NFTs (creating from scratch)
2. 1-of-1 pieces

More Info... Minting NFTs:
artblocks.io
Like a lottery
Algo generated artwork
Artwork attributes make it more/less unique
Could get bog standard or get lucky with rare piece
Expect cost of 0.01 to 0.08 eth

More Info... 1-to-1s...
Like swing trades, set it and forget, come back in 6 months
Only ever 1 made
Usually a long term hold
Usually bought from a well known artist
Buying a 1-of-1 NFT allows you to directly support the artist
You are **directly investing** in the artist
- if they have made 2 before and both sold, buy the 3rd
- may allow artist to go full-time
- may produce more/better artworks attract higher-rollers
- may then charge much more and your early work much more valuable
CBS is a big fan of 1-to-1 NFTs
He'll usually take profits from flipping minted "profile pic" NFTs to eventually buy a 1-to-1 NFT

Artblocks:
Historically significant
Home / hub original sources of NFTs
1) Curated projects 
2) Artist playground
3) Factory
Curated projects tend to hold value very well
Curated projects tend to be more liquid
*** IF NEW TO NFTs, just stick to Artblocks ***
Can search for Artblock projects / sales from Opensea "art blocks"

PFP: Profile picture projects (Punks)
Digitized clout chasing
i) Collectability
ii) Flex: if have this as profile pic, then know that person has an NFT (JPEG) worth $150k
Sotheby's and Christies have both listed Punks
Artblocks & punks are the top two; 2 top dogs
Artblocks has more projects & price points
Punk no liquidity issues, elite / rich collectors, thriving

PFP: Profile picture projects (Bored Ape)
Significance
Can stand up to Punks (not AS strong as punks though)
Hold their value
Great community behind it; famous collectors

NFTs: Avoid Shit!
EG: Bored Aped Punk; cash grab
Only if big hype then a very quick flip
CBS bought degenz; minted 20 of them for 0.08 each, he got 1 of the 10 whales of 10,000 degenz sold for 15 eth that night. The other 19 degenz in his account cannot even be sold though

All NFTs have their own discord channel
The NFT market is very different to trading market
EG: Elevated Deconstructions; only 200 minted; whales own 150 of these, they will never sell, so supply has been reduced by 75%; supply gets reduced
People will buy a collection of NFTs and then just leave them alone / forget about them thus reducing the supply


Summary:
1. MetaMask (erc20)
2. Opensea best for seconadry sales
3. Artblocks best for noobs
[[4.0 Superrare for 1-to-1 pieces (not for noobs)]]
[[4.1 Foundation for 1-to-1 pieces (not for noobs)]]


Artblocks (holds value & huge markup potential)
Squiggles up 5x in 1 month (Aug 2021)
Fidenzas up 340x (0.1eth to 34eth floor / cheapest)
Artblocks.io
Artblocks twitter
Artblocks Discord

NFT Sniping on Openseas (eg: Shitty BoredApePunks)
Don't mint your own
Wait for initial listings on Openseas seconadry market
People don't know the value of these yet (rarer pieces)

NFT is not a bubble, it will have big cycles though (up & down)

Video #2

Mutant Ape Yacht Club
Very active liquid market (lots of bot offers)
Bots provide liquidity to sell your NFT if you think you've made a mistake

Initial 24 hours after OpenSeas listing.
Initially pumps (fomo)
Dips (buyers remorse, people can't sell, so drop their price lower, causes others to think they need to sell too)
Usually after 72 hours, we'll see a fairer floor price.

BAYC original
MAYC nice spin off

Technique 1: Floor price
Don't care about the art; get in at the lowest floor price and profit when all floor prices rise (only care about lowest cost)

Technique 2: Rarer Skins (Oppertunistic; search OpenSeas by type (MAYC has many types) and then watch to see if someone lists a NFT at too low of a price for its type (eg: M2 DMT)

Technique 3: Rarity.tools. Can use this website to see the rarity of NFTs (fur, ear-ring, eyes, mouth, clothes, background, etc... gives a rarity score based on this)
But people will hunt based on
(i) rarity of specific thing (eg: fur)
(ii) number of traits
(iii) looks / aesthetics (especially at the upper price points)

Mutant Garden Seeder (MGS)
Avid Lines
Pulse Squares
Parallel cards (based on game, so success of NFT based on success of game)

Twitter Accounts to follow for NFTs
He mentioned to follow Twitter accounts on his 210829 Twitch feed
Bharat Krymo (a huge whale)
Dive into their threads look for open and engaging discussion, not shilling "did you see rare lions did a 10x last week"; ignore shillers.
Look at who the big boys follow and interact with
