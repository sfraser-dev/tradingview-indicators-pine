*** General notes from Twitch streams

*** RSI div info 
Ideally, RSI divs will be clean and sharp (like a discernable harmonic)
- There is no such thing as hidden bullish divergence; anyone tells you this; block them
- Ignore Stoch RSI if divergence trader; too fast; trash
Coin had 20 candles for "bull div", he said slightly too far, a bit dodgy, not valid.
Coin had clear support zone (in these 20 candles) that had broken down
So coin has "dodgy" bullish div and a breakdown of support = not a bullish div
-
BTC example 210523
12H: potential bullish div forming
1D: ackward/invalid as not enough candles (only 4)
-
Huge sell off (210519) would expect to see some slow down in the selling via D1 rsi bullish div (they were not, so expect lower lows eventually)
-
Huge sell off (210519): On D1, can see ADA RSI has not fallen as much relative to other coins - would therefore expect more lows. But cannot short the lows, there is H4 supply so can look to short that.
-
How does RSI print bullish div? It's about how heavy PA has sold off. Look for a reduction of the selling pressure into the lows (LLs made with less strength).
-
A HTF RSI div completes; he'll just market buy (not set limits for a dip)
-
RSI div normally in extremes. If not in extremes, need more confluence. "incredible strenth by market essentially fake-breaks" or they are signs that we're eventually going to turn it around and sell-through".
-
He'll take a trade solely on a RSI div
-
HTF (eg: 3D) divs indicate trend reversals
LTF (eg: H4) divs are for bounces
--
His biggest overall PnL comes from H4 divs
-
RSI 50 level in HTF trending markets is a good entry level
-
If RSI is hovering below 50, expect bearish continuation
If RSI is hovering above 50, expect bullish continuation 


*** CBS info
He has very "clean" timeframes: 1M, 1W, 3D, 1D, 4H, 1H, 15m, 5m, 1m
-
He was a tick scalper
Only uses PA (not scalping now; swing trading); only cares about how much price has moved
https://coldbloodedtraders.com/
Renko
He was initially just a scalper (ETH scalping only for 12 months)
Scalping mindset too much; cannot leave PC; cannot switch off
PC
Switched to swing after became a dad
Scalpers use vLTF and play both sides of a range. Ranging environments best for scalpers. Trending markets are not good for scalpers (21006)
Renko is a "tick chart", based only on "dollar value moved", it's not based on time. TPO / MP is a "tick chart" too.
Sclping timeframes; whatever works best for you (1m, 3m, 5m, 10m, 12m, 15m, etc, etc).
-
What makes a bear market
Lose of MS on HTF is what CBS uses to determine bear market
On daily, need to close above 60k to take the key high
-
Don't need books, just watch CryptoCred on Youtube
On Chain Analysis are cunts
On chain analysis is dog shit (because they are always wrong; they were saying can never go below 50k (crashed to 30k))
On chain is just a fad like EW, divergence, Wycoff, PA/OB; now just on chain's turn to be the fad
He uses market structure (not PA with OBs)
He uses the candle closes to draw PA divs, not highs/lows (unlike Ducc)
-
Only indicators he uses are RSI and awesome indicator (see his renko charts).
-
He's joined Haven crypto group; $250 per month
- (210606 stream Awesome Indicator first 20 mins)
He uses Awesome Indicator as it is slower (34 period) whereas RSI is 14 period. Awesome is not as quick as RSI. So Awesome gives him a good idea of "slow down (in momentum) through a region". Awesome "cleaner in tracking over longer timeframes".
"You will see the divergence better on Renko and the Awesome Indicator will work well".
-
Divergence occurring below 70 is unusual and normally sign of market-wide selloff. Can say probability of this div being invalidated is high and trade it as such
-
RSI divs should play out in about 14 candles max
There is no minimum number of candles needed though for divs
But peaks shouldn't be too close together but no official minimum amount of candles
Div confimred when div occurs on peaks and then locked in when candle closes confirming "clean peaks"

Spot and "proper trades"
Getting in on retests are MEMES
Close above SR market enter a long
Close below SR market enter a short

Breakout trade
Enter 50% on close above level
Enter 50% on retest of level (better average entery) but may never get this retest
SL below the start of the impulse
(Impulse should MSB/pattern break and RSI good too (rsi div, 50 retest or break above 50))

"extension point" heading up to extreme to create 

*** Alts v. Btc
ALT/USDT: need BTC to slowly go higher to do well
ALT/BTC: need BTC to go sideways a bit then up slowly

*** Coins
210519: Nasdaq QQQ:
1M bear div playing out to potentially correct
Only convirmed end May
Took 2-3 red months to play out
SPX & DOW not as bad; each leg up higher momentum
QQQ each leg up less momentum

210521 SRM / SOL: look for 4H bull divs

210523 balperp 
Looks at D1: "no Divs so I can't play anything on the daily"
Looks at H4: "Extends too far past these points here so no valid div present". It was an M structure (L, HL, LL) so final leg is HL to LL so not valid (even though the L to LL would be valid, cannot ignore the HL (middle point of the M))

linkperp 210523
Very simple, when link into D1 oversold RSI, good buy opportunity

210523: He really likes metals right now (gold / silver and palladium)
Metals are less volatile than crypto; perhaps easier to trade for newbies
1h47: Silver 6 year consolidation breakout to 1 year consolidation (weekly)... 50+ target
Platform he uses for traditionals: CMC & Sasko bank

210606: Different people have different criteria for what is a bull or bear market. He uses market structure, others will use MA (eg: 200ma)

210606: Symmetrical triangle will break more often in the direction of the trend. Downtrend = down, uptrend = up.

210606: "He thinks candle-stick patterns are horse-shit"

210606:
In a strong uptrend (bull), bad news will get shrugged off and good news will get a strong reaction
In a strong downtrend (bear), good news will get shrugged off and bad news will get a strong reaction

"Support is support UNTIL it's not." 
"Resistance is resistance UNTIL it's not."
Don't be afraid to take action incase it breaks; don't second guess it; take your precautionary action AFTER it fails
Wait until price moves away from demand / supply to enter (ie: make sure it has been established first)
Don't anticipate; wait for confirmation.

Trading Journal:
Use your own discord server as you can paste tradingview charts in there and easily keep notes (entry, SL, exit, emotional state etc).

Mental state: You can "work" trading 60 hours a week and lose $5000. Imagine working normal job 60 hours per week and paying your boss $5k for your hard work.

Don't care about today or this week. Care about where you are in 5 years.

He doesn't like holding any crypto in a downtrend (so he's not yield-farming right now, although he would like to be yield farming).

Renko needs a premium account on TradingView.

Marking a range, he marks with candle closes (made with renko or line charts)

SFP: SFP is just a sweep ("we've taken the highs but closed below == sweep)

CBS is regarded as a "professional trader" so he is allowed to trade on FTX (classification of pro).

"The awesome oscillator is interchangeable with RSI"

"Strength is the reclaiming of significant levels"

Renko for scalping (no time-frame) with divergences
Got to be more aggresive when scalping

For stocks, he looks to TP at HTF bearish divergence.

He doesn't use log charts, doesn't use open interest
He likes Wycoff as an underlying theory, not for signals

He tells people he is a "trader", but keeps it surface level.
Doesn't say he spends 8 hours a day looking for divergences to position into futures contracts.
But even his close friends don't know that he's CBS (his wife does).

Never FOMO into news related pumps; they retrace quickly.

The Haven Notes CBS:
We use Awesome and not RSI with Renko
Traditional brick size 300 for BTC

He sorts watchlist by percentage change to get big movers

A, B, C, D grade trades:
A grade: HTF RSI div into HTF support + AO confluence 
D grade: retest of support

RSI momentum plays are what he did as a scalper
Comfortable being underwater & knowing not instantly in profit.
If scalper, you want to be instantly in profit or you need to get out of trade.
Swing trading needs more patience than scalping.
Swing trading needs less time at PC than scalping
Swing trades should last days to months
Swing trading crypto is tough (see EGLD). Best to use spot
Binance and FTX allow spot shorting (margin)

AO is slower so a bit more reliable in div printing, but since slower, may miss some divs
RSI is faster than AO

Crazy auction: PEGS NTF Matt Fury one on one collectibles. He's the creator of Pepe the Frog

When market is dumping, check 15m chart. Are bullish divs getting nuked? Don't try and long if they are!
Eg: clear bullish div (3x) normally free money... don't stand in the way of the market when it's like this. Don't long.

If a breakdown is happening on HTF, we can spot it coming on LTF

Be wary of longing diagonal breakouts straight into horizontal resistance

RSI rotation to the upside (from oversold to overbought)
RSI rotation to the downside (from overbought to oversold)

After large impulse (eg: down), it takes time for whales to exit positions (iceberg orders at support) so it will chop / range for a bit as they do this.
Also, other whales will start buying in order to build long position at support (iceberg orders)
Retail are expecting huge recovery of impulse and will get rinsed / chopped up as their emotions are heightened and discord / CT / telegram is blowing up 

If coin is straight chadding / trending, bear divs in extremes won't work. Must have context with PA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0edhH20a-Uo  (Haven chill video)
Loma success: High conviction alt plays that you rotate around with good PA.
1-to-1 he teaches feels he's chasing all the time
Proactive plays, position ahead of time, wait for the pop... THEY ALWAYS COME!
Most are looking at the big pops now and wanting to chase / FOMO things that are popping (asking on the stream when to join the lastet pumping coin)
Ignore the noise

Introduction to Divergences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR1slopvFoQ
He doesn't like hidden divs
- they tend to mask proper divs when trading into them
- wrong side of trade
- against the momentum actually coming through
Indication to market changing, momentum change
LOCKED IN: twin peaks (rsi bearish div)
LOCKED IN: rsi rise, peak, fall, rise, lower peak, FALL
LOCKED IN: two DISTINCT peaks on candle close = LOCKED IN
ENTRY: take 50% position on candle lock-in
ENTRY: next 50% of position on move out of extreme
ENTRY: entry positions like this as may be triple-drive (3x) and we're countering the trend (like harmonics)
When can we say the div has played out?
PLAYED-OUT: End to end plays (extreme to extreme)
PLAYED-OUT: Bear div candles will have PA lows, close when these taken
PLAYED-OUT: Close on a significant move in our favour (big candle, especially if this takes out bear div candle lows
PLAYED-OUT: Close if cross from below to above 50 level
PLAYED-OUT: Apply these closing strategies to time-frames <D3
PLAYED-OUT: HTF (D3, W, M) divs indicate full trend reversals and will have much further targets to aim for
SMALL-RSI-GAPS are POOR divs (tight divs are ineffective)
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: check lower time-frames for proper div
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: if tight RSI on H1, try 15m for proper div and trade as 15m setup (ie: a quicker more aggressive setup than H1)
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: want approx 9,10,11,12,13,14 candles for divs
LONG-DIVS-3X: if long triple div, check a higher time-frame
LONG-DIVS-3X: proper div setup (2 peaks) should be there
LONG-DIVS-3X: long triple div on 15m? check H1 and adjust trade accordingly
LONG-DIVS-3X: want approx 9,10,11,12,13,14 candles for divs
Many retail "need" to be in a position so MMs just need

Context. Wait (patience) for lock-in. Don't mess with RSI unless in extremes (exception uber trends)

Momentum with RSI video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AECBV8y0prc
- RSI is a measure of MOMENTUM (remember this)
- These RSI plays can be implemented on any time-frame
BREAK-50: Above 50 = bullish
BREAK-50: Below 50 = bearish
BREAK-50: Breaking through 50 level is SIGNIFICANT achievement for momentum; trade with the momentum (& trend)
BREAK-50: The 50-level decides who is winning the market tug-of-war (bulls or bears)
SR-50: HTF *trending* market, expect 50 to act as retest support. 50 level will not be support in ranging market
SR-50: We're looking for clear trending environments for 50 retests (good for trend joining (get in on HL) or keeping positions open)
MSB&50-CROSS: Break MS & break RSI 50 = new trend
MSB&50-CROSS: HTF trening market (eg: D1)
MSB&50-CROSS: Break MS (eg: HH) and RSI breaks above 50 = bullish momentum
MSB&50-CROSS: Instead of a MSB, it could be a pattern (diagonal / channel / etc) with rsi crossing above 50
SR-50: If downtrend, 50-level will act as resistace from below.
SR-50: If uptrend, 50-level will act as support from above.
SR-50: A lot of CBS trades is ANTICIPATING RSI breaking through the 50-level (confluent with a S/R level (MSB) too)
SR-50: Like MAs when the trend is too strong (won't touch the MA; it'll front run it) RSI will also front-run the 50-level if the trend is too strong
50&MA-GAPS: RSI monitors momentum in trending markets (like moving averages gaps)
50&MA-GAPS: MA big gap = strong trend (HH & HL)
50&MA-GAPS: MA compression = potential trend reversal
50&MA-GAPS: Bounce off 50 = momentum still strong (HH, HL)
50&MA-GAPS: Lose 50 level after a holding a long time significant (especially with bearish MSB too)
EXTREMES: Look at historical amount of time in overbought and oversold to gauge momentum of coin

LTF tips and tricks scalping video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYLACPfqx7s&t=103s

Big breakthrough for him was completely FLUID position building (not all in on one entry (eg: 2x div), instead start build entry but allow the possibility of 3x div).

FLUID position building changes MINDSET from defensive / negative to aggressive / positive (AGGRESIVE POSITION BUILDING)

Most people intra-day trading use 5m charts
Div still valid? Don't worry about time. Build FLUID position
Div not valid anymore? Close position
Build FLUID position without worrying about time.

Diagonal breakouts
Need BULLISH MS (uptrend)to play bullish breakouts
Need BEARISH MS (downtrend)to play bearish breakouts

Usually after a big impulse from a div, it will consolidate for a while (not impulse straight back in a V recovery). You will have time, don't rush.

ALICE & AXS tend to CONSOLIDATE then pop. If you see consolidation, watch for the pop.

Playing Divergences - TA Help with FTX (not from The Haven)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QUsgSZneY
RANGES: Playing divs within ranges is great
RANGES: Bear div into range-high / resistance, great
RSI-WEAK: Appreciate market conditions (eg: impulse BO of 2 month consolidation range into a large uptrend, don't short bear divs, try and get in on HLs of the new uptrend)
RSI-WEAK: flip the logic, look for bullish divergences
RSI-WEAK: If market strongly up-trending or down-trending don't use rsi divs, they are weak and it's what gives rsi a bad name (rsi meme)
MORE-14-CANDLES: huge ETH uptrend and bearish divs... continuous price HHs & continous rsi LHs gives one huge bear div much more than 14 candles (not good though as ETH is trending up hard and divs no use in massive trending markets)

RSI - How I use it & Advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dbRcZh_AHY&t=92s
Momentum indicator
- BO opportunities
- join in on the trend
- divs aligned with macro trend stronger
- counter trend div be more aggressive with TPs
14-CANDLES: If number of candles creating div exceeds 14 then it's not valid.
14-CANDLES: He doesn't completely stick to this rule but very good guidance for him
50-LEVEL: 50-level is a reset button for rsi (fresh start)
50-LEVEL: retest, cool off from or join existing trend
50-LEVEL: tells us (1) price cooled from strong trend an 50 point is natural resting place OR it's telling you price is ranging
50-LEVEL: CBS likes H4 best for analysing cooling off periods
50-LEVEL: Strong uptrend then cool off into extreme oversold then he's interested, then seeing cross above 50 very interested
50-LEVEL: he doesn't want to mess with asset chopping around 50 as this indicates indecision
MEME: "divergences can't be trusted in the trend"
MEME: need to use RSI in context with PA


=======
RSI Summary
=======
1. RANGING: Divs (~14 candles max, extremes, lock-in)
2. TRENDING: Retest of 50 level in strong TRENDING markets
3. BREAKOUT: 50 level cross with MSB / pattern-BO (momentum, new trend)
(build FLUID positions)
