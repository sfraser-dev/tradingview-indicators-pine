===== Bitcoin for Ledges 23/05/2021

SZ is from Birmingham
Been trading full time for 10 years (2021; started 2011)

Fast aggressive moves up lead to fast aggresive moves down.

Is it a "range" deviation?
Confirmed deviation rather than breakout = more downside
Confirmed deviation rather than breakdown = more upside

Sometimes we get:
1) perfect retest (hit old range high then pump)
2) squeeze (hit old range low, deviate, stopping out perfect retest longs, then pump)
We never know which one is going to happen, just prepare for them. SZ marks out level where he thinks each will be confirmed

Range accumulation, BO, retest, accumulation...

You can manually mark the SR levels OR
You can mark out weekly highs and lows (another way of doing it)
See what "fits best" for levels (mark monthlys, weeklys, or "normal" range style (RP/koz)) 

Start off on the very HTF so you know where the magnet points will be. All I've done is mark out the monthly high and low from the previous few months.

Marked out 2021 Feb high (58300) & low (33300) for BTC.
Midpoint of any range acts like a magnet (March low & Jan high were confluent with this range midpoint so he marked them off)

He uses trigger points
Range. Any deviation then range-reclaim he'll play the range.
Trigger point is mid range. Get below mid range then target is range low (respecting the other levels (d/s) he's marked in the range too as targets)
Level to level
As well as ranges, deviations can occur on S/R levels too; play these deviations the same as a range deviation
Keep it simple: "This is range high (resistance); deviate, then take short on the reclaim retest (breaker); target the next LOGICAL level (eg: TP1)
"Breaks below mid-range and holds, that's his target trigger".

By marking weekly highs and low, he's looking for "intra-week" plays... the actual range might be a bit wider.

KISS: Keep it simple
Mark boundaries (range) so we know how to play bigger picture trending moves (BOs) or know when to cut it (if range reclaims it).
BREAKOUT: Trigger would be break out of range, but need to mark target areas for TP (eg: untapped highs) so always take profit and not "up only to moon"
RANGE: Otherwise, trade the range via any deviation / reclaim up and down ping-pong back and forth 

Level-to-level
Range bound. Deviate above reclaim, short to next logical level (eg: mid-range). 
Can also deviate resistance if we're range bound: Along the way, ranging a bit (SR level), deviate above this SR (take stops, perhaps hit LTF supply) then reclaim the SR level, compund short).

Monday's H/L sets the range for the week; backtest it to see how it plays out well.

Don't need patterns when in a range, they're just excuses for entries. Level to level.
Pay more attention to patterns when the coincide with RH or RL, not when they're within the range.

Where am I wrong (invalidation)
Where are my targets?
Level to level

A fast (thin / inefficient) move into resistance / range-high he doesn't really trust (inefficiencies filled in and still in range). 
A fast move break-out above resistance / range-high he trusts more (range-high becomes support & supply to breaker when ineffciencies filled in)

Play the range. Place your SL to accomodate a fake-out / deviation.

Aim for consolidations (demands / supplys) and highs / lows.

TraderSZ doesn'tuse volume.
Doesn't trade on Sunday; doesn't trust weekend moves.

If we come back to a range that worked out before; we can use it again.

Big spike down is more profit taking than buying.

Higher time-frame determines the directional context

Mid-ranges are powerful

After a big dump, look at the next bounce candle (on the weekly or daily). It'll more than likely form the range.
Backtest it and it will be clear

Is it a breakout above or just a deviation. Look at "context" (price action). If PA looks week, then it most likely a deviation so you can short.

Invalidation like Koz:
Wait for the break/deviation below the level (SZ).
Wait for the break of the low (Koz).
AFTER it has been broken; then invalidation is below the level of the break. Put SL just below this break.

Have multiple scenarios.
1. deep pull back (to a lower level already marked out, deviate/sweep/sfp and reclaim = trigger)
2. shallow pull back (to a lower level already marked out, deviate/sweep/sfp and reclaim = trigger)
3. trend continuation (down, back up to recent low, deviate/sweep/sfp, trigger is reclaim).
** deviate/sweep/sfp is to a "supply level"

Stop run pattern: comes down, takes out the stops, pops up, then comes back down again.

When in sync with the trend, basic chart patterns work.
When patterns out of sync with the trend, get fakeouts.

What is a breakout; hold above means consolidates above the level

Level to level is reject from a LEVEL/RANGE-POINT and get back in on a retest of D/S nearby.

HTF ranges (quarterly (3M), monthly, etc) if it wicks above (even massively) but then closes back inside, proves that it is a range / resistance. MLM: Monthly Levels Matter.

Two kinds of retest, back to the range-high OR not quite to the range high (ascending & inverted scallop) 

For his ranges, ANTICIPATE a deviation and get in on the range reclaim.
Even a new range, ANTICIPATE deviation into it (then out) & enter when it reclaims the new range.

===== LIVE SESSION – NEW YORK 16/06/2022
HIGH-PROB: Setups higher up are always there for us, and these are the higher probability plays (krillin also says this)
SCALE: Don't knife-catch, if trying to do so, scale in (like CBS building a position fluidly, buy more as price increases)

===== TRIGGERS & INVALIDATIONS (PART 1) 04/07/2021

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL USING RANGES
CONSOLIDATION: consolidation leads to expansion
SLs: SZ uses wider SLs but will but on trigger against him
BREAK-HOLD: trigger "break and hold" above a key horizontal support level can be anything: MAs, MS, footprints

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL (RANGE BOUND MARKET) 28/10/2020
DEVIATION: Mark range (or levels)
DEVIATION: Assume it's a deviation, because if it's not a deviation, it's trending
DEVIATION: Likes to see break above level, consolidate above the level a bit, then break back below the level.
DEVIATION: Consolidate above before breaking back below is high probability
DEVIATION: SPIKING above then breaking back below is not high probabiity 
OCD: He has OCD, he cannot place limit orders for entries, he manually enters at market (like CBS)
SCANNING: Looks for impulses then periods of consolidation
SCANNING: He only trades the consolidation, not spikes (impulses)
SCANNING: Spikes result in messy PA
STOPS: He uses very wide stops, sometimes 0.5R trades (very high winrate)
STOPS: Like Loma, he doesn't place SL below recent low, but below a prior lower low (two levels of safety, cater for SFP)
STOPS: He can wait a week for these very high winrate setups so he'll put real size into the trade
SPIKES: Don't enter on spike level reclaims
SPIKES: Spikes are fast moves (impulses)
SPIKES: Often, fast moves (spikes) will pull back
SPIKES: Often lead to messy PA
TRENDLINE: TLs work with context (deviation back below horizontal level and below TL too)
METHODOLOGY: Drops, consolidates and then breaks (for short)
METHODOLOGY: Drops: breaks below a key horizontal level
METHODOLOGY: Consolidates: needs to consolidate / chop for a bit below the key level (consolidation cluster)
METHODOLOGY: Breaks: breaks below the consolidation cluster (now enter short)
METHODOLOGY: This is the SZ method, it is very specific
DISCIPLINE: Have realistic targets (don't over-milk it) - must always take money out the market
DISCIPLINE: Have patience to wait for the setups
DISCIPLINE: Don't be greedy
BOOK: Atomic Habits is "fucking brilliant"
DISCIPLINE: A lot of the best traders draw simple trendlines, but they have the correct mindset / psychology / behaviour
