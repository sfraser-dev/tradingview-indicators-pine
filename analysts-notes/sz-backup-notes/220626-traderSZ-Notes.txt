=====

OLD: SZ is from Birmingham
OLD: Been trading full time for 10 years (2021; started 2011)

OLD: He writes on his charts with EPIC PEN (different

OLD: Fast aggressive moves up lead to fast aggresive moves down.

OLD: Is it a "range" deviation?
OLD: Confirmed deviation rather than breakout = more downside
OLD: Confirmed deviation rather than breakdown = more upside

OLD: Sometimes we get:
OLD: 1) perfect retest (hit old range high then pump)
OLD: 2) squeeze (hit old range low, deviate, stopping out perfect retest longs, then pump)
OLD: We never know which one is going to happen, just prepare for them. SZ marks out level where he thinks each will be confirmed

OLD: Range accumulation, BO, retest, accumulation...

OLD: You can manually mark the SR levels OR
OLD: You can mark out weekly highs and lows (another way of doing it)
OLD: See what "fits best" for levels (mark monthlys, weeklys, or "normal" range style (RP/koz)) 

OLD: Start off on the very HTF so you know where the magnet points will be. All I've done is mark out the monthly high and low from the previous few months.

OLD: Marked out 2021 Feb high (58300) & low (33300) for BTC.
Midpoint of any range acts like a magnet (March low & Jan high were confluent with this range midpoint so he marked them off)

OLD: He uses trigger points
OLD: Range. Any deviation then range-reclaim he'll play the range.
OLD: Trigger point is mid range. Get below mid range then target is range low (respecting the other levels (d/s) he's marked in the range too as targets)
OLD: Level to level
OLD: As well as ranges, deviations can occur on S/R levels too; play these deviations the same as a range deviation
OLD: Keep it simple: "This is range high (resistance); deviate, then take short on the reclaim retest (breaker); target the next LOGICAL level (eg: TP1)
OLD: "Breaks below mid-range and holds, that's his target trigger".

OLD: By marking weekly highs and low, he's looking for "intra-week" plays... the actual range might be a bit wider.

OLD: KISS: Keep it simple
OLD: Mark boundaries (range) so we know how to play bigger picture trending moves (BOs) or know when to cut it (if range reclaims it).
OLD-BREAKOUT: Trigger would be break out of range, but need to mark target areas for TP (eg: untapped highs) so always take profit and not "up only to moon"
OLD-RANGE: Otherwise, trade the range via any deviation / reclaim up and down ping-pong back and forth 

OLD: Level-to-level
OLD: Range bound. Deviate above reclaim, short to next logical level (eg: mid-range). 
OLD: Can also deviate resistance if we're range bound: Along the way, ranging a bit (SR level), deviate above this SR (take stops, perhaps hit LTF supply) then reclaim the SR level, compound short).

OLD: Monday's H/L sets the range for the week; backtest it to see how it plays out well.

OLD: Don't need patterns when in a range, they're just excuses for entries. Level to level.
OLD: Pay more attention to patterns when the coincide with RH or RL, not when they're within the range.

OLD: Terminology
OLD: Where am I wrong (invalidation); know when I'm wrong
OLD: Where are my targets?
OLD: Level to level
OLD: I was wrong
OLD: Happy days
OLD: Let's refine it
OLD: That's that
OLD: We're looking for the clear cut entry
OLD: Block / box it out (what he says about his OBs)
OLD: Displacement (instead of impulse)
OLD: Dealing range (normal part of choppy range)
OLD: What do we have here
OLD: That's done

OLD: A fast (thin / inefficient) move into resistance / range-high he doesn't really trust (inefficiencies filled in and still in range). 
OLD: A fast move break-out above resistance / range-high he trusts more (range-high becomes support & supply to breaker when ineffciencies filled in)

OLD: Play the range. Place your SL to accomodate a fake-out / deviation.

OLD: Aim for consolidations (demands / supplys) and highs / lows.

OLD: TraderSZ doesn't use volume.
OLD: Doesn't trade on Sunday; doesn't trust weekend moves.

OLD: If we come back to a range that worked out before; we can use it again.

OLD: Big spike down is more profit taking than buying.

OLD: Higher time-frame determines the directional context

OLD: Mid-ranges are powerful

OLD: After a big dump, look at the next bounce candle (on the weekly or daily). It'll more than likely form the range.
Backtest it and it will be clear

OLD: Is it a breakout above or just a deviation. Look at "context" (price action). If PA looks week, then it most likely a deviation so you can short.

OLD: Invalidation like Koz:
OLD: Wait for the break/deviation below the level (SZ).
OLD: Wait for the break of the low (Koz).
AFTER level has been reclaimed, enter and put SL just below the low of the deviation / sweep

OLD: Have multiple scenarios.
OLD: 1. deep pull back (to a lower level already marked out, deviate/sweep/sfp and reclaim = trigger)
OLD: 2. shallow pull back (to a lower level already marked out, deviate/sweep/sfp and reclaim = trigger)
OLD: 3. trend continuation (down, back up to recent low, deviate/sweep/sfp, trigger is reclaim).
OLD: ** deviate/sweep/sfp is to a "supply level"

OLD: Stop run pattern: comes down, takes out the stops, pops up, then comes back down again.

OLD: When in sync with the trend, basic chart patterns work.
OLD: When patterns out of sync with the trend, get fakeouts.

OLD: What is a breakout; hold above means consolidates above the level

OLD: Level to level is reject from a LEVEL/RANGE-POINT and get back in on a retest of D/S nearby.

OLD: HTF ranges (quarterly (3M), monthly, etc) if it wicks above (even massively) but then closes back inside, proves that it is a range / resistance.
OLD: MLM: Monthly Levels Matter.

OLD: Two kinds of retest, back to the range-high OR not quite to the range high (ascending & inverted scallop) 

OLD: For his ranges, ANTICIPATE a deviation and get in on the range reclaim.
OLD: Even a new range, ANTICIPATE deviation into it (then out) & enter when it reclaims the new range.

===== Joined TraderSZ group £78pcm 220617 =====
===============================================

===== LIVE SESSION – NEW YORK 16/06/2022
HIGH-PROB: Setups higher up are always there for us, and these are the higher probability plays (krillin also says this)
SCALE-IN: Don't knife-catch, if trying to do so, scale in (like CBS building a position fluidly, buy more as price increases)

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL USING RANGES
CONSOLIDATION: consolidation leads to expansion
SLs: SZ uses wider SLs but will but on trigger against him
BREAK-HOLD: trigger "break and hold" above a key horizontal support level can be anything: MAs, MS, footprints

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL (RANGE BOUND MARKET) 28/10/2020
DEVIATION: Mark range (or levels)
DEVIATION: Assume it's a deviation, because if it's not a deviation, it's trending
DEVIATION: Likes to see break above level, consolidate above the level a bit, then break back below the level.
DEVIATION: Consolidate above before breaking back below is high probability
DEVIATION: SPIKING above then breaking back below is not high probabiity 
OCD: He has OCD, he cannot place limit orders for entries, he manually enters at market (like CBS)
SCANNING: Looks for impulses then periods of consolidation
SCANNING: He only trades the consolidation, not spikes (impulses)
SCANNING: Spikes result in messy PA
STOPS: He uses very wide stops, sometimes 0.5R trades (very high winrate)
STOPS: Like Loma, he doesn't place SL below recent low, but below a prior lower low (two levels of safety, cater for SFP)
STOPS: He can wait a week for these very high winrate setups so he'll put real size into the trade
SPIKES: Don't enter on spike level reclaims
SPIKES: Spikes are fast moves (impulses)
SPIKES: Often, fast moves (spikes) will pull back
SPIKES: Often lead to messy PA
TRENDLINE: TLs work with context (deviation back below horizontal level and below TL too)
METHODOLOGY: Drops, consolidates and then breaks (for short)
METHODOLOGY: Drops: breaks below a key horizontal level
METHODOLOGY: Consolidates: needs to consolidate / chop for a bit below the key level (consolidation cluster)
METHODOLOGY: Breaks: breaks below the consolidation cluster (now enter short)
METHODOLOGY: This is the SZ method, it is very specific
DISCIPLINE: Have realistic targets (don't over-milk it) - must always take money out the market
DISCIPLINE: Have patience to wait for the setups
DISCIPLINE: Don't be greedy
BOOK: Atomic Habits is "fucking brilliant"
DISCIPLINE: A lot of the best traders draw simple trendlines, but they have the correct mindset / psychology / behaviour

===== PROFIT TAKING
TP-METHODS: ATR indicator (not so much)
TP-METHODS: Fib extensions (1.272, 1.618 & 2.00)
TP-METHODS: Ranges: consolidations
TP-METHODS: Ranges: Range levels
TP-METHODS: SR / structure
TP-METHODS: Uses a combination of the above
5m watched **NOT FINISHED**

===== USING MONDAY RANGE FOR TARGETS
MEASURED: Use target 1:1 measured move of whole Monday range
MEASURED: Use target 1:1 measured move of half Monday range
MEASURED: Use target 1:1 measured move of quarter Monday range 
CORRECT: When range-EQ acts as support & resistance (nice "fit"), know range is correct

===== TRIGGERS & INVALIDATIONS (PART 1) 04/07/2021
MIN-CRITERIA-TRIGGER: Deviation above (stop-run) then back below SR
MSB: He determines MSBs based on ranges
MSB: Doesnt look at HH, HL, HH etc (well, he does, to determine the trend HTF to decide to look for shorts / longs)
MSB: Looks at consolidations
PRACTICE: Get 30 examples done (series of trades)
PRACTICE: Will have a set of results "I'm doing OK here!"
PRACTICE: Get used to entering trades
PRACTICE: This will stop struggling with execution
TRENDING: In trending market, close above mini-range is entry
TRENDING: SL below deviation under RL
TRENDING: Entering breakout trades, closing above range LTF, in HTF trending market
TRENDING: After a trending move you get a range
34m watched

===== Break in Market Structure
KEY: D1 & H4 mark key levels
KEY: He needs market to be coming off a key (HTF) level
RANGE-DEV: Mark ranges so that they have deviations already
RANGE-DEV: Deviations prove the range
MSB: HH, HL, HH gets too messy
MSB: m5-mini-range = H1 down candle; MSB if impulse up
MSB: Breakout of mini-range (via impulse / displacement)
MSB: In on retest of old high
MSB: Trendline break is also MSB
MSB: MSBs in ranges revolve a lot around SR
TL: He uses wicks for treandlines
TL: Use TLs in confluence with ranges only)
UNDER-OVER: This is his key blueprint (like UB)
UNDER-OVER: Under-over (UO) is basically a breaker structure around RL
BREAKER: Last consolidation before market broke down (under / supply)
BREAKER: Wait / patience get back within the range above old supply (over / supply-now-demand-breaker) and retest breaker from above
BREAKER: Waiting on breaker like this (under-over pattern) will result in HH, HL, HH, HL market structure when range is reclaimed
FRACTAL: Big UOs and small UOs in same range
FRACTAL: Ranges within ranges
FRACTAL: Break one range into another range via UO patterns
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: Initial deviation well below RL (dev1)
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: Another deviation not so far below RL (dev2)
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: dev1 will be demand zone to dev2
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: Should be HH, HL, HL after dev2 back into range
RP: Rektproof range play demands and breakers
TRIGGER: Drop (below SR), Consolidate, Break (dump)
TRIGGER: Pop (above SR), Consolidate, Break (pump)
CLEAR-CUT: We're looking for the clear cut entry (high probability)
25m0s for screenshots

===== 220622-CryptoMarketReview-breakAndHold-compounding
BREAK-HOLD: Break and hold is enough
BREAK-HOLD: Break important SR and holding (chop for a bit) is enough for entry (preempt impulse away from consildation)
TRADERS-OTHERS: TraderXO and TraderISO good at fundamentals
TRADERS-OTHERS: Will get them on stream when time to buy spot agaon
