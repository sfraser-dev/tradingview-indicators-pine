=====

OLD: SZ is from Birmingham
OLD: Been trading full time for 10 years (2021; started 2011)

OLD: He writes on his charts with EPIC PEN (different

OLD: Fast aggressive moves up lead to fast aggresive moves down.

OLD: Is it a "range" deviation?
OLD: Confirmed deviation rather than breakout = more downside
OLD: Confirmed deviation rather than breakdown = more upside

OLD: Sometimes we get:
OLD: 1) perfect retest (hit old range high then pump)
OLD: 2) squeeze (hit old range low, deviate, stopping out perfect retest longs, then pump)
OLD: We never know which one is going to happen, just prepare for them. SZ marks out level where he thinks each will be confirmed

OLD: Range accumulation, BO, retest, accumulation...

OLD: You can manually mark the SR levels OR
OLD: You can mark out weekly highs and lows (another way of doing it)
OLD: See what "fits best" for levels (mark monthlys, weeklys, or "normal" range style (RP/koz)) 

OLD: Start off on the very HTF so you know where the magnet points will be. All I've done is mark out the monthly high and low from the previous few months.

OLD: Marked out 2021 Feb high (58300) & low (33300) for BTC.
Midpoint of any range acts like a magnet (March low & Jan high were confluent with this range midpoint so he marked them off)

OLD: He uses trigger points
OLD: Range. Any deviation then range-reclaim he'll play the range.
OLD: Trigger point is mid range. Get below mid range then target is range low (respecting the other levels (d/s) he's marked in the range too as targets)
OLD: Level to level
OLD: As well as ranges, deviations can occur on S/R levels too; play these deviations the same as a range deviation
OLD: Keep it simple: "This is range high (resistance); deviate, then take short on the reclaim retest (breaker); target the next LOGICAL level (eg: TP1)
OLD: "Breaks below mid-range and holds, that's his target trigger".

OLD: By marking weekly highs and low, he's looking for "intra-week" plays... the actual range might be a bit wider.

OLD: KISS: Keep it simple
OLD: Mark boundaries (range) so we know how to play bigger picture trending moves (BOs) or know when to cut it (if range reclaims it).
OLD-BREAKOUT: Trigger would be break out of range, but need to mark target areas for TP (eg: untapped highs) so always take profit and not "up only to moon"
OLD-RANGE: Otherwise, trade the range via any deviation / reclaim up and down ping-pong back and forth 

OLD: Level-to-level
OLD: Range bound. Deviate above reclaim, short to next logical level (eg: mid-range). 
OLD: Can also deviate resistance if we're range bound: Along the way, ranging a bit (SR level), deviate above this SR (take stops, perhaps hit LTF supply) then reclaim the SR level, compound short).

OLD: Monday's H/L sets the range for the week; backtest it to see how it plays out well.

OLD: Don't need patterns when in a range, they're just excuses for entries. Level to level.
OLD: Pay more attention to patterns when the coincide with RH or RL, not when they're within the range.

OLD: ===== Terminology
OLD: Where am I wrong (invalidation); know when I'm wrong
OLD: Where are my targets?
OLD: Level to level
OLD: I was wrong
OLD: Happy days
OLD: Let's refine it
OLD: That's that
OLD: We're looking for the clear cut entry
OLD: Block / box it out (what he says about his OBs)
OLD: Displacement (instead of impulse)
OLD: Dealing range (normal part of choppy range)
OLD: What do we have here
OLD: That's done
OLD: And we're done (target hit)
OLD: Probability wise
OLD: What would be ideal scenario?
OLD: Is that clear?!
OLD: Am I making sense?
OLD: Good enough
OLD: Is everybody with me?
OLD: ===== Terminology


OLD: A fast (thin / inefficient) move into resistance / range-high he doesn't really trust (inefficiencies filled in and still in range). 
OLD: A fast move break-out above resistance / range-high he trusts more (range-high becomes support & supply to breaker when ineffciencies filled in)

OLD: Play the range. Place your SL to accomodate a fake-out / deviation.

OLD: Aim for consolidations (demands / supplys) and highs / lows.

OLD: TraderSZ doesn't use volume.
OLD: Doesn't trade on Sunday; doesn't trust weekend moves.

OLD: If we come back to a range that worked out before; we can use it again.

OLD: Big spike down is more profit taking than buying.

OLD: Higher time-frame decides the directional context

OLD: Mid-ranges are powerful

OLD: After a big dump, look at the next bounce candle (on the weekly or daily). It'll more than likely form the range.
Backtest it and it will be clear

OLD: Is it a breakout above or just a deviation. Look at "context" (price action). If PA looks week, then it most likely a deviation so you can short.

OLD: Invalidation like Koz:
OLD: Wait for the break/deviation below the level (SZ).
OLD: Wait for the break of the low (Koz).
AFTER level has been reclaimed, enter and put SL just below the low of the deviation / sweep

OLD: Have multiple scenarios.
OLD: 1. deep pull back (to a lower level already marked out, deviate/sweep/sfp and reclaim = trigger)
OLD: 2. shallow pull back (to a lower level already marked out, deviate/sweep/sfp and reclaim = trigger)
OLD: 3. trend continuation (down, back up to recent low, deviate/sweep/sfp, trigger is reclaim).
OLD: ** deviate/sweep/sfp is to a "supply level"

OLD: Stop run pattern: comes down, takes out the stops, pops up, then comes back down again.

OLD: When in sync with the trend, basic chart patterns work.
OLD: When patterns out of sync with the trend, get fakeouts.

OLD: What is a breakout; hold above means consolidates above the level

OLD: Level to level is reject from a LEVEL/RANGE-POINT and get back in on a retest of D/S nearby.

OLD: HTF ranges (quarterly (3M), monthly, etc) if it wicks above (even massively) but then closes back inside, proves that it is a range / resistance.
OLD: MLM: Monthly Levels Matter.

OLD: Two kinds of retest, back to the range-high OR not quite to the range high (ascending & inverted scallop) 

OLD: For his ranges, ANTICIPATE a deviation and get in on the range reclaim.
OLD: Even a new range, ANTICIPATE deviation into it (then out) & enter when it reclaims the new range.

===== Joined TraderSZ group £78pcm 220617 =====
===============================================
Left / Cancelled SZ's locked Twitter Group 220817
(1) Following his setups VERY hard, update videos of 30 mins would have heaps of possible plays for each coin, need his range levels to do this
(2) Had macro range levels marked out in a video, said if you want to know how he got them, it's in the previous videos, but there are thousands of videos!
===============================================

===== LIVE SESSION – NEW YORK 16/06/2022
HIGH-PROB: Setups higher up are always there for us, and these are the higher probability plays (krillin also says this)
SCALE-IN: Don't knife-catch, if trying to do so, scale in (like CBS building a position fluidly, buy more as price increases)

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL USING RANGES
CONSOLIDATION: consolidation leads to expansion
SLs: SZ uses wider SLs but will but on trigger against him
BREAK-HOLD: trigger "break and hold" above a key horizontal support level can be anything: MAs, MS, footprints

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL (RANGE BOUND MARKET) 28/10/2020
DEVIATION: Mark range (or levels)
DEVIATION: Assume it's a deviation, because if it's not a deviation, it's trending
DEVIATION: Likes to see break above level, consolidate above the level a bit, then break back below the level.
DEVIATION: Consolidate above before breaking back below is high probability
DEVIATION: SPIKING above then breaking back below is not high probabiity 
OCD: He has OCD, he cannot place limit orders for entries, he manually enters at market (like CBS)
MARKET-BUT: SZ market buys just like CBS, not placing bids or asks; trigger hits and he enters
SCANNING: Looks for impulses then periods of consolidation
SCANNING: He only trades the consolidation, not spikes (impulses)
SCANNING: Spikes result in messy PA
STOPS: He uses very wide stops, sometimes 0.5R trades (very high winrate)
STOPS: Like Loma, he doesn't place SL below recent low, but below a prior lower low (two levels of safety, cater for SFP)
STOPS: He can wait a week for these very high winrate setups so he'll put real size into the trade
SPIKES: Don't enter on spike level reclaims
SPIKES: Spikes are fast moves (impulses)
SPIKES: Often, fast moves (spikes) will pull back
SPIKES: Often lead to messy PA
TRENDLINE: TLs work with context (deviation back below horizontal level and below TL too)
METHODOLOGY: Drops, consolidates and then breaks (for short)
METHODOLOGY: Drops: breaks below a key horizontal level
METHODOLOGY: Consolidates: needs to consolidate / chop for a bit below the key level (consolidation cluster)
METHODOLOGY: Breaks: breaks below the consolidation cluster (now enter short)
METHODOLOGY: This is the SZ method, it is very specific
DISCIPLINE: Have realistic targets (don't over-milk it) - must always take money out the market
DISCIPLINE: Have patience to wait for the setups
DISCIPLINE: Don't be greedy
BOOK: Atomic Habits is "fucking brilliant"
DISCIPLINE: A lot of the best traders draw simple trendlines, but they have the correct mindset / psychology / behaviour

===== PROFIT TAKING
TP-METHODS: ATR indicator (not so much)
TP-METHODS: Fib extensions (1.272, 1.618 & 2.00)
TP-METHODS: Ranges: consolidations
TP-METHODS: Ranges: Range levels
TP-METHODS: SR / structure
TP-METHODS: Uses a combination of the above
5m watched **NOT FINISHED**

===== USING MONDAY RANGE FOR TARGETS
MEASURED: Use target 1:1 measured move of whole Monday range
MEASURED: Use target 1:1 measured move of half Monday range
MEASURED: Use target 1:1 measured move of quarter Monday range 
CORRECT: When range-EQ acts as support & resistance (nice "fit"), know range is correct

===== TRIGGERS & INVALIDATIONS (PART 1) 04/07/2021
MIN-CRITERIA-TRIGGER: Deviation above (stop-run) then back below SR
MSB: He decides MSBs based on ranges
MSB: Doesnt look at HH, HL, HH etc (well, he does, to decide  the trend HTF to decide to look for shorts / longs)
MSB: Looks at consolidations
PRACTICE: Get 30 examples done (series of trades)
PRACTICE: Will have a set of results "I'm doing OK here!"
PRACTICE: Get used to entering trades
PRACTICE: This will stop struggling with execution
TRENDING: In trending market, close above mini-range is entry
TRENDING: SL below deviation under RL
TRENDING: Entering breakout trades, closing above range LTF, in HTF trending market
TRENDING: After a trending move you get a range
LIVE-EXAMPLE-RULES: ******************
LIVE-EXAMPLE-RULES: Example at range-EQ, he'd rather take trades at extremes of RH or RL (RH, RL, EQ are key levels)
LIVE-EXAMPLE-RULES: Rules: stop-run (or SR) into key level (RH, RL, EQ)
LIVE-EXAMPLE-RULES: ******************
LIVE-EXAMPLE-RULES: Must accept our targets can't always be as big as we want
LIVE-EXAMPLES: Final 5 to 3 minutes of the video
LIVE-EXAMPLES: Using SRs (highs and lows like pierre) to define the ranges
LIVE-EXAMPLES: Drop, hold (consolidate), break is the trigger
INTRAWEEK-RANGES: This means scalping / day-trading
INTRAWEEK-RANGES: Rules do change a bit for day-trading as he becomes more aggresive
WEEKEND: He doesn't trust weekend PA, it over-extends
TWITTER: He just continuously post bearish shit on Twitter to piss people off, but he takes many longs, be logical
INDICATORS: He doesn't use indicators, SR (standard), ranges, deviations
10-YEARS: He's been using this method since 2011 (10 years)
10-YEARS: Try it with a series of 30 trades, he knows what works, this will grow your confidence so much
10-YEARS: Even if it doesn't work, you'll see where you went wrong
10-YEARS: Journal! Even hedge fund traders journal. If you don't journal, you won't make it.
10-YEARS: If you've been doing this a couple of years and not getting anywhere, ask yourself why? You're not doing what others are willing to do; this is a cut-throat business
10-YEARS: Journalling is a form of discipline, and you need discipline to make it


===== Break in Market Structure
KEY: D1 & H4 mark key levels
KEY: He needs market to be coming off a key (HTF) level
RANGE-DEV: Mark ranges so that they have deviations already
RANGE-DEV: Deviations prove the range
MSB: HH, HL, HH gets too messy
MSB: m5-mini-range = H1 down candle; MSB if impulse up
MSB: Breakout of mini-range (via impulse / displacement)
MSB: In on retest of old high
MSB: Trendline break is also MSB
MSB: MSBs in ranges revolve a lot around SR
TL: He uses wicks for treandlines
TL: Use TLs in confluence with ranges only)
UNDER-OVER: This is his key blueprint (like UB)
UNDER-OVER: Under-over (UO) is basically a breaker structure around RL
BREAKER: Last consolidation before market broke down (under / supply)
BREAKER: Wait / patience get back within the range above old supply (over / supply-now-demand-breaker) and retest breaker from above
BREAKER: Waiting on breaker like this (under-over pattern) will result in HH, HL, HH, HL market structure when range is reclaimed
FRACTAL: Big UOs and small UOs in same range
FRACTAL: Ranges within ranges
FRACTAL: Break one range into another range via UO patterns
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: Initial deviation well below RL (dev1)
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: Another deviation not so far below RL (dev2)
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: dev1 will be demand zone to dev2
DOUBLE-DEV-DEMAND: Should be HH, HL, HL after dev2 back into range
RP: Rektproof range play demands and breakers
TRIGGER: Drop (below SR), Consolidate, Break (dump)
TRIGGER: Pop (above SR), Consolidate, Break (pump)
CLEAR-CUT: We're looking for the clear cut entry (high probability)

===== 220622-CryptoMarketReview-breakAndHold-compounding 
Twitter short video
BREAK-HOLD: Break and hold is enough
BREAK-HOLD: Break important SR and holding (chop for a bit) is enough for entry (preempt impulse away from consildation)
TRADERS-OTHERS: TraderXO and TraderISO good at fundamentals
TRADERS-OTHERS: Will get them on stream when time to buy spot agaon

RECLAIM-TRIGGER-LONG: (1) Need to bounce up from major SR and
RECLAIM-TRIGGER-LONG: (2) ... need to reclaim local lows
RECLAIM-TRIGGER-LONG: (3) Reclaim of local lows will make the dip to major SR a deviation
RECLAIM-TRIGGER-LONG: Pop above local lows, consolidate / hold, then break up again is the long TRIGGER  
RECLAIM-TRIGGER: "sz-reclaim-both-majorSR-and-localSR-for-trigger1.JPG"
HALF-SIZE: Half-size when trading against the trend
STOPS: Crypto needs wider stops more volatile craziness
ALGO: As well as his manual TA, he has a hybrid (algo) that automates his triggers
ALGO: He paid someone to code it for him
ALGO: "sz-his-algo-system.png"
ALGO: CRYPTO MARKET REVIEW 28/06/2022 (5 minute mark)
RANGE-SPLITS: RH (100%), EQ (50%) & RL (0%) the main parts of the range
RANGE-SPLITS: Splitting to 5 levels (75% & 25% added) allows for entries on HLs (range EQ reclaimed, consolidate, pump above 75%, consolidate, trigger)
RANGE-SPLITS: Like MA-trend getting in on 2nd retest

PULLBACKS: rather than big pumps, pullbacks are good as they give us lows to put our SLs under
PULLBACKS: If no pullback, instead straight up impulse, nothing we can do, no entry for us
PULLBACKS: Trigger-trifecta for demand / OB; pullback into demand, reclaim a range level (SR), then consolidation with MSB after range level (SR) reclaimed

RANGE-LEVEL-MARKING: He uses the Fib tool then manually adds in horizontal lines (manual input coordinates)
RANGE-LEVEL-MARKING: This is how he gets different colours, thicknesses and styles (line, dash)

METHOD-HIGH-PROBABILITY: "sz-high-probability-trade-ideas-methodology.png"
METHOD-HIGH-PROBABILITY: Playing range BO and possible back into range play OK too (as deviation below range was confirmed via the initial BO pump)

TRIGGER: Break above local (ltf PA) and HTF (range) levels
TRIGGER: Initially, break levels zig-zag, up and down quite a bit, then settles less volatile consolidate above the levels, MSB is above this settled PA
TRIGGER: Can enter 50% on consolidation above levels, then the other 50% on the MSB of the settled PA
TRIGGER: "sz-break-and-hold-above-nice-example4-PA-NEEDED-for-TRIGGER.JPG"
MLM: Monthly levels matter (for HTF ranges, also M3, M6 and M12)

INVALIDATION-SETUPS: Can take a trade based on a clear invalidation (with RR on your side), perhaps enter 50%
INVALIDATION-SETUPS: Can use clear invalidation to enter trade early (perhaps on two of three trigger-trifectas; local-SR & HTF-SR but no MSB-after-hold-above-trigger) 

MULTI-YEAR-BTC-RANGE: he pulled from 2017 high to 2018 low
MULTI-YEAR-BTC-RANGE: he then copied this range and stacked it on itself again and again (appended / stacked)
MULTI-YEAR-BTC-RANGE: 20k to 69k was a multi-year deviation
MULTI-YEAR-BTC-RANGE: "sz-macro-range-levels-BTC-bitmex-p9-FOUND-IT.JPG"
MULTI-YEAR-BTC-RANGE: He used XBTUSD Bitmex perpetual inverse swap chart

MACRO-REFINED: pull-back to the macro level then pump OR instant trend-continuation via a refined "split-macro" level 

RANGE-STACKING: Can stack old ranges to create new bigger ranges
RANGE-STACKING: Especially when range, MASSIVE deviation, then back into the old range
RANGE-STACKING: "sz-sf-sol-range-stacking1-previous-3month-range.JPG"
RANGE-STACKING: Incredible accurancy

"Crypto-Market-Review-12_07_2022–TraderSZ-cherry-picking-increasing-PnL-wee.mp4"
DEVIATION: Once it does a deviation, it shouldn't do it again
CHERRY-PICK: He only cherry-picks clear setups, WAIT for them
CHERRY-PICK: wait but win-rate high and PnL goes up
CHERRY-PICK: most of my plays are BO plays (within a wider range)
CHERRY-PICK: "sz-cherry-picking-trades-BO-within-wider-range.png"
TRIGGER-TRIFECTA1: TL (diagonal), SR, MSB (trigger on MSB)

===== TRADING LEVEL TO LEVEL USING RANGES (concept video)
RANGE-MARKING: Impulse down (first low) to high (first high) - note RP says lows and highs must be SWING low/high
RANGE-MARKING: Further proven with sweeps and deviations
RANGE-MARKING: Further proven with EQ being a pivotal levels
RANGE-MARKING: RH, RL, EQ, .25 & .75 is SZ default (5 levels)
RANGE-MARKING: See the "RANGE-STACKING:" info above too
EXPANSION: range consolidation leads to expansion
EXPANSION: Switch off HTF range levels and then use local SR
EXPANSION: ... then add back in the HTF range levels
EXPANSION: Local SR + HTF SR + hold-then-MSB = trigger-trifecta for EXPANSION
REFINE-LOCALLY-TO-SCALP: while WAITING for expansion, can scalp
REFINE-LOCALLY-TO-SCALP: : break 2 levels in the main HTF 5-level-range into another 5 level range
REFINE-LOCALLY-TO-SCALP: : these range levels should act as natural SR levels
REFINE-LOCALLY-TO-SCALP: shows market is moving in increments (certain rotations)
REFINE-LOCALLY-TO-SCALP: range levels are to be used as a confluence only
TRADING-STYLE: He uses wide stops will usually close manually before hitting
TRADING-STYLE: Usually has conservative entries
HOLD-THE-MSB: local LTF hold / consolidate then MSB can be used as the final trigger on anything (eg: MA, footprint, HTF BoS, etc)
