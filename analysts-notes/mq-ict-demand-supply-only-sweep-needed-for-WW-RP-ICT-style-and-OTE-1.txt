Optimal Trade Entry OTE

But also shows info about ICT (Inner Circle Trading) demand, supply and breakers only needing to sweep an old high (not MSB / WW-LB it like Martyn taught)

--
RP breakers need to:
Sweep or MSB the low
Only close above the supply to validate breaker
RP does this in RANGES, usually with higher timeframes (H12/D1)
RP is aggressive with his breaker confimations (eg: H12 breaker confirmed via taking a swing high from 15min chart)

Martyn-ATZ breakers:
Sweep or MSB the low then must MSB the high for validation. Any timeframe, range not needed.
MB is more conservative with his breaker confirmation

--
WW / RP / ICT Demand Zones / Muro
Demand only needs to sweep the high to validate

--
MB (ATZ) Demands Zones / JohnnyB
Demand needs to MSB the high to validate
Note: WW refers to these as Liquidity Bases (LBs) and these are "stronger" than his demand zones (MSB & untouched)
JohnnyB and the "new wave" of SMC mark their demands like MB
JohnnyB it's not a valid demand if there is liquidity just below it

-- RP MSS confirmation and CBS method very similar
(1) RP breakers (in his ranges) are like a CBS rsi 50-cross with MSB (the impulse breaking the supply produces rsi 50 cross and get in on retest of the MSB). But the breaker is the candle used for the MSB.
(2) Don't be a hero with RR, these breakers are RPs biggest winners (high win rate but lower RR).
(3) It's like he's playing them up to Martyn's MSB breaker confirmation.
(4) RP candle usuage different, generally the whole candle

-- RP breakers (and Martyn's too based on freshnesss rule)
Supply cannot be tapped and then make a new low (invalid breaker)

-- Muro (demands like RP, WW & ICT)
