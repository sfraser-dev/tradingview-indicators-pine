CBS - Aggressive OTM Options Trading + Other set ups
220615

-- aggressive
TA: What he looks for 2 conditions in AGGRESIVE options play
TA: 1. Trend (strong)
TA: 2. Continuation (level loss; turndown from rsi 50)
TA: Strong trend, breakdown, rejection
TA: Consolidation phase has concluded now wanting exapansion
So look for really agressive expiries (expiries near)
BOOKS: Always check the books (adjacent price stikes)
BOOKS: Can sometimes get similar price for 24k calls and 23k calls!
LIQ: Delta liquidity issue for larger accounts (not 1000's and 1000's)
PnL: He spent 4k on recent BTC degen puts and made 150k (37x)
DIVS: Options great for div plays that are good
DIVS: People often forced out of div plays before the impulse
DIVS: Options are great for helping people stay in position
TIMEFRAME: agressive degen plays H1 chart (expect playout in 24 hours with divs)
TIMEFRAME: H1 expect to happen in 24 hours, triple div, would expect playout in next 24 hours or the div becomes invalid because of the number of candles printed

-- not aggressive
TIMEFRAME: Daily chart, swings, OTM long-term expiry.
TIMEFRAME: Options very very good for sticking with HTF div plays: you put your money on the table and stick with it, no personal psyops
STRADLE: Not as agressive as short time-frame expiries
STRADLE: Buy call and put at the same strike (play volatility)
STRADLE: Look for as close as possible pricing in the call and the put (exact would be ideal)
STRADLE: Stradle is a volatility play, playing a significant move (in either direction)
STRADLE: CBS opened a stradle that expires just after FOMC (ie: playing FOMC volatility)
STRADLE: Idea is one of the options will fail and the other will gain massively (covering the loss of the one that fails easily)
STRADLE: His FOMC stradle call cost 8.13 and the puts cost 8.18 (pretty decent stab at a stradle play)
STRADLE: Getting values close to each other for a stradle should be roughly at current price
STRADLE: Prices like this don't happen often, so need to check frequenty for stradle conditions to be met
STRADLE: Stradle will be punished if price comes back to the price you bought them at (need a big move on the market to get paid, need volatility)
--
SWING: Longer dated OTM calls (btc current price 21k, aim for 12k)
SWING: Play very aggressive (approx 50% btc drop) downside
SWING: Saying BTC will drop about 50% in 5 weeks is a degen play - if it works, rewarded handsomely (only need to buy with a few hundred bucks and see if it hits)
SWING: Longer dated plays OTM but for huge moves - bottom of the list for options priority
SWING: CBS went BTC puts 1st July 2022 at $14000 (he took $14000 as it's the lowest available strike price for July)
SWING: Low probabily only buy a little big big reward IF it happens
