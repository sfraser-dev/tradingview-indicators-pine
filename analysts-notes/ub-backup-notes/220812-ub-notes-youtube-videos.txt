RANGE-VIDEO: If you're at all interested in my Trading Ranges I highly suggest you check out this video. It's truly a must watch. Very rarely am I happy with how my videos turn out but this one I believe to be a great educational resource.: https://youtu.be/zMfHscpmCX0 @everyone
RANGE: "ub-borne-range-creation-and-analysis-UB-fully-agreed.JPG"

RANGE-SETTING: Wait for a large impulse before setting the range

WEEKEND-DEVIATION: Weekend deviation of the range (scammy) then back into the range during the week, easy range play

MAs: Says "MA/EMA traders will like the structure too" but refuses to put MAs on his charts

UNDER-OVER: The under-over pattern is like a SZ deviation
UNDER-OVER: Can be used on horizontals and TLs
UNDER-OVER: One of his go-to patterns

SWING-RISK: Will risk between 4-8% of portfolio on a swing (depending on setup)

SL-PLACEMENT: Big wick that swept all highs, don't need to place SL above this big wick as it has swept all liquidity already, place above more recent, lower, highs

DEVIATIONS: Assume deviations of ranges, not break-outs

PA-TRADER: He's a PA trader (usually with ranges, like SZ)
PA-TRADER: Doesn't use indicators
PA-TRADER: PA is the basis of most indicators, so if understand PA, no need for indicators

NOT-A-SWEEP: If small sweep of low without a strong reaction, instead consolidates, then don't consider a sweep as more SLs will be placed below the new consolidation

FEW-GOOD-TRADES: Just need a few good trades a month
FEW-GOOD-TRADES: In trends, go full risk, don't sleep
FEW-GOOD-TRADES: In choppyness, lower risk, less trades
FEW-GOOD-TRADES: Don't try and LTF scalp the chop, 90% fail

CONSOLIDATION-UNDER-RESISTANCE: Bullish sign in strong market 
CONSOLIDATION-UNDER-RESISTANCE: Less bullish in weak market

WEEKEND-SCAM: Weekend scam pumps creating a RH deviation are ripe to be shorted to RL

FAVORITE-SETUP: APE: Setup he looks for constantly, this pattern is insane, spam me if you see it (3m50s into review)
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE: review: https://youtu.be/eCpOJyUQzdI
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE: HTF trend down, looking for shorts
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE: Range formed, deviation above the highs FOR a FEW HOURS, short to RL on range reclaim
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE https://youtu.be/eCpOJyUQzdI
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE spam me if you see this setup please (bear market, range, highs deviated for a few hours, back into range)
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE Clearly defined highs
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE The more attempts to break the highs (the longer the "supply" zone) the better (more liquidity to take)
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE Devition above, then BACK into the range
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE: Clear well defined highs, break above, break back within the highs, look for a short
FAVORITE-SETUP: APE: Will see this setup everywhere
