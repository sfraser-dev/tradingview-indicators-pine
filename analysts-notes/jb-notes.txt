===== OB tips
OB: Don't just place bids at OBs, wait for a reaction from them
OB: Switch to lower time-frame, PA in OB, look for sweep
OB: "look for sweeps inside strong (MB) OBs, it'll change your life forever"... ie: CHoCH in the OB
OB: Ver much SZ style, wait for pump, consolidate, LTF-break-MSB

OB: "jb-strong-OBs-look-for-sweeps-life-will-change-forever.JPG"
OB: Loma: demand OB is first up candle after a down move
OB: Loma: supply OB is first down candle after an up move
OB: Loma-Rahmat: OB is candle that sweeps local liquidity
OB: Talin: It's an OB ZONE, not a single candle
OB: It's not a valid OB+ if there is liquidity just below it

NEOK-M1>M1: "jb-neok-trade-recaps-M1-to-M1-meaning.JPG"

===== NOTION: JB's TA Methodology:
MB-MS: Use wicks to mark HH, HL, LH, LL (MB style)
MB-OB: Use MB style OB (big impulse)
MB-OB: Use OB that wasn't retested immediately upon creation
MB-OB: ie: Use a WW Liquidity Base
-- HTF POI with LTF Entries
HTF-POI (i): OB retest by itself
HTF-POI (ii): liq-grab into FVG or OB (Murfski)
HTF-POI (iii): Monday's range
HTF-POI (iv): SFP / sweep
LTF-ENTRY: liq-grab into HTF POI
LTF-ENTRY: initial reaction producing ltf msb in correct direction (leaves fvg)
LTF-ENTRY: fvg retested producing seconardy reaction
LTF-ENTRY: enter on successful secondary reaction
LTF-ENTRY-EX: (DOWN) sweep of htf highs (bearish), ltf bearish MSB (leaves fvg*), enter after successful fvg* retest
LTF-ENTRY-EX: (UP) sweep of htf lows (bullish), ltf bullish MSB (leaves fvg**), enter after successful fvg** retest
-- Secret sauce
SS-STEP1.0: HTF-POI created (eg: bearish OB)?
SS-STEP2.0: would I take similar trade on BTC (eg: bearish)?
SS-STEP3.0: LTF-entry created (eg: bearish entry)
SS-STEP3.1: no resting liquidity nearby (eg: below)
SS-STEP3.2: no knife-catching
