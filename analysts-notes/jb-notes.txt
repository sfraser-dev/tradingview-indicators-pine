===== OB tips
OB: Don't just place bids at OBs, wait for a reaction from them
OB: Switch to lower time-frame, PA in OB, look for sweep
OB: "look for sweeps inside strong (MB) OBs, it'll change your life forever"... ie: CHoCH in the OB
OB: Ver much SZ style, wait for pump, consolidate, LTF-break-MSB
OB: "jb-TA-LTF-entries-007.JPG"
OB: "jb-strong-OBs-look-for-sweeps-life-will-change-forever.JPG"
OB: Loma: demand OB is first up candle after a down move
OB: Loma: supply OB is first down candle after an up move
OB: Loma-Rahmat: OB is candle that sweeps local liquidity
OB: Talin: It's an OB ZONE, not a single candle
OB: It's not a valid OB+ if there is liquidity just below it

MONDAY: His biggest losing day is always a monday (from journal)
MONDAY: So he doesn't trade Monday

WICKS-SCALPING: He waits for wicks into his PoIs then retracement

JB-PROCESS-3-THINGS-TO-LOOK-FOR: OBs, ranges and FVG is what he uses day in and day out
JB-PROCESS-3-THINGS-TO-LOOK-FOR: 3-THINGS: liq to liq
JB-PROCESS-3-THINGS-TO-LOOK-FOR: 3-THINGS: external liq to internal liq
JB-PROCESS-3-THINGS-TO-LOOK-FOR: HTF PoI, LTF PoI, entry when it REACTS, stops below recent low, market entry (doesn't use limit orders)
JB-PROCESS-3-THINGS-TO-LOOK-FOR: draw OBs and liq grabs on HTF, LTF for entries (fvg, BoS)
JB-PROCESS-3-THINGS-TO-LOOK-FOR: equal lows / highs are the biggest magnet for liquidity, don't take trade if liquidity resting against you

BOS-CHOCH: https://forex.quora.com/What-is-are-the-difference-s-between-change-of-character-and-break-of-structure-in-forex-trading

REZ-MACRO-DOWNTREND-LONGS: in a macro downtrend all longs are countertrend when you zoom out enough..
REZ-MACRO-DOWNTREND-LONGS: ..there has been no daily msb, no weekly msb - in this case, take the H4 chart as the HTF chart.

===== MEANINGS
FU: Means Fuck You, Sweep
FU: Consolidation under bearish sweep means dump
FU: Consolidation above bullish sweep means pump
FU: "jb-GMT-short-FU-is-liquidity-raid2-consolidation-under-FU-bearish.JPG"
FU: Like SZ - break, consolidate, break again
NEOK-M1>M1: "m1 > m1" means 1 min sweep followed by m1 break of structure (sometimes just writes it "m1m1")
NEOK-M1>M1: "jb-neok-trade-recaps-M1-to-M1-meaning.JPG"
NEOK-M1>M1: Note: these are CHoCHs; BoS is for the high timeframe, CHoCH is for the low timeframe (see BOS-CHOCH:)

===== NOTION: JB's TA Methodology:
MB-MS: Use wicks to mark HH, HL, LH, LL (MB style)
MB-OB: Use MB style OB (big impulse)
MB-OB: Use OB that wasn't retested immediately upon creation
MB-OB: ie: Use a WW Liquidity Base
-- HTF POI with LTF Entries
HTF-POI (i): OB retest by itself
HTF-POI (ii): liq-grab into FVG or OB (Murfski)
HTF-POI (iii): Monday's range
HTF-POI (iv): SFP / sweep
LTF-ENTRY: liq-grab into HTF POI
LTF-ENTRY: initial reaction producing ltf msb in correct direction (leaves fvg)
LTF-ENTRY: fvg retested producing seconardy reaction
LTF-ENTRY: enter on successful secondary reaction
LTF-ENTRY-EX: (DOWN) sweep of htf highs (bearish), ltf bearish MSB (leaves fvg*), enter after successful fvg* retest
LTF-ENTRY-EX: (UP) sweep of htf lows (bullish), ltf bullish MSB (leaves fvg**), enter after successful fvg** retest
-- Secret sauce
SS-STEP1.0: HTF-POI created (eg: bearish OB)?
SS-STEP2.0: would I take similar trade on BTC (eg: bearish)?
SS-STEP3.0: LTF-entry created (eg: bearish entry)
SS-STEP3.1: no resting liquidity nearby (eg: below)
SS-STEP3.2: no knife-catching

===== neok how he finds his setups
SETUP-TEMPLATE: "jb-neok-how-he-finds-his-setups.png"
SETUP-TEMPLATE: (1) Mark out H1 levels on BTC and ETH
SETUP-TEMPLATE: (2) wait for price to these levels
SETUP-TEMPLATE: (3) LTF confirmation at these levels long/short
SETUP-TEMPLATE: (4) prefers LTF BoS (impulse) resulting in a FVG
SETUP-TEMPLATE: (5.0) (short) SL above the high, TP at SSL (sell side liquidity) or FVG fill
SETUP-TEMPLATE: (5.1) (long) SL below the low, TP at BSL (buy side liquidity) or FVG fill
METHODOLGY-EXPLAINED-H1SR-m5m5-FVG: Find a clear SR level on H1 (H1SR)
METHODOLGY-EXPLAINED-H1SR-m5m5-FVG: Look for sweep of a low followed by a MSB of a high around the H1SR (m5m5; means m5 sweep followed by m5 MSB)
METHODOLGY-EXPLAINED-H1SR-m5m5-FVG: watch for FVG to for an entry (buy) in FVG
METHODOLGY-EXPLAINED-H1SR-m5m5-FVG: "jb-neok-his-ict-methodology-explained-in-detail-2-H1SR-m5m5-fvg.png"
METHODOLGY-EXPLAINED-LONDON-CHoCH: CHoCH short based on taking HTF liquidity (London high) then LTF Bos with FVG entry 

===== Begin generic
RISK: For his scalping, risks usually 5% of his portfolio
RISK: With his tight scalping stops, usually risks 50-70% of his portfolio at 10x lev
RISK: 2000 portfolio, 50% = 1000, 10x = 10000 pos size, 1% SL, risking $100 (100/2000 = 5%)
===== End generic

===== Masterclass Video PoI (Nov 2022)
JB-POIs: 1) OBs, 2) Liq-grab, 3) Ranges
JB-POIs: Note: his liq-grabs don't have to be sweeps, can be closes to (deviation liq-grabs)
OB: JB marks same as MB style, they need to give a MSB via big impulse (with FVG too)
OB: down candle before impulse up that broke MS
OB: up candle before impulse down that broke MS
OB: OB much better if it occurs AFTER a HTF liq-grab
POI-EX1: (1) HTF liq-grab (extLiq)
POI-EX1: (2) then move that creates LTF MSB (intLiq) (MB-style OB created with FVG)
POI-EX1: "jb-HTF-OB-occurring-at-a-liqGrab-btc.png"
POI-EX2: (1) Can also be in a HTF OB (extLiq) 
POI-EX2: (2) and then a LTF sweep (intLiq) occurs into the this HTF OB (murfski likes these)
POI-EX2: "jb-liqGrab-into-HTF-OB-eth.png"
POI: prices typically move from external liq (HTF) to internal liq (LTF)
POI: want to be positioned for next liquidity draw (if above, want to long)
POI: (1) HTF POI
POI: (2) LTF POI 
POI: (3) see reaction 
POI: (4) stops above previous taken liquidity (for short)
POI: (5) trade invalid if resting liquidity above (for short)
REACTION: doesn't use limit orders as he wants to see reaction first
REACTION: "jb-reaction-he-is-looking-for.png"

===== Masterclass Video Market Structure (MS) (Nov 2022)
KILLZONES: they work in crypto as well as fx
KILLZONES: asia H, asia L, prev deay H, prev day L
KILLZONES: killzones give more volatility (like NY open) as it's when big boys make there plays in fx / stocks, crypto also follows that sentiment
FAKE-MSB-POIs: lots of fake MSBs, need to wait for price to come to PoIs to give better chance of playing out
FAKE-MSB-POIs: no reaction at POI, then NO TRADE

===== Masterclass Video Order Blocks (OBs) (Nov 2022)
RP: put Rektproof's OB PDF on screen (agrees with this)
RP: JB learned most of his TA from RP. RP is a beast
POI: often have an OB on HTF and FVG on LTF combine these two for great trade setup
JB-OBs: where large orders entered the market and where they are likely to defend
JB-OBs: Uses martyn's style, must close below previous low for a MSB (not a wick below)
JB-OBs: wait to hit OB and then reverse before entering manually / market. Don't place limits, especially in crypto
JB-OBs: JB uses ALL of the candle (wicks too) to mark the OB (like RP)
JB-OBs: what is needed to be valid for JB:
JB-OBs: (1) HTF external liq-grab (liquidity engineered)
JB-OBs: (2) HTF external MSB
JB-OBs: (3) HTF external OB created
JB-OBs: (4) LTF internal watch for reaction on OB retest (ltf BoS, ltf sweeps PoI/OB, ltf fvg at PoI/OB).. see this ALL THE TIME (JB entry model)
JB-OBs: Should use H1 upwards for OBs (H1, H4, ++)
JB-OBs: If price front runs a OB then 
JB-OBs: loves ltf sweeps in his PoIs
JB-OBs: love PA where there's FVGs and OBs created (martyn style)
JB-OBs: reaction at OB: just don't want to see price go straight through OB, want to manually see it defended first
JB-OBs: he will sometimes try and catch a wick using internal liquidity being taken
JB-OBs: he uses ancheFvg tool a lot
JB-MONDAYS-HIGH-RANGE: only time he'll short instantly is when Monday's high is taken (but internal liq-grab of Monday's high, not an external liq-grab)
JB-SECRET-SAUCE: basically, sweeps at his PoIs
JB-EXECUTION: will give himself 2 attempts at the same trade (when scalping with tight SLs), no more than 2!
JB-EXECUTION: doesn't tend to trade BTC, charts BTC but trades alts off of that
JB-EXECUTION: like Loma, JB says BTC PA is just to difficult / sophisticated, easier on alts

===== Masterclass Ranges (Nov 2022)
MON: Monday is a no trade day for JB, he waits for Monday's range to form
MON: backtesting shows 77% of mon low or mon high being ran on Tues
RP: pulled up RPs range educational material
JB: uses only 1, 0.5 and 0 on his Fib tool for ranges
BIAS: if in HTF downtrend, favour shorting range high (as opposed to longing range low)
EQ: price above EQ is bullish, price below EQ is bearish
BYBIT: Can adjust leverage on-the-fly on bybit

===== Masterclass Secret Sauce (Nov 2022)
