*** RSI General Info Collection
***
RSI-INFO: Ideally, RSI divs will be clean and sharp (like a discernable harmonic)
RSI-INFO: There is no such thing as hidden bullish divergence; anyone tells you this; block them
RSI-INFO: Ignore Stoch RSI if divergence trader; too fast; trash
RSI-INFO: Coin had 20 candles for "bull div", he said slightly too far, a bit dodgy, not valid.
RSI-INFO: Coin had clear support zone (in these 20 candles) that had broken down
RSI-INFO: So coin has "dodgy" bullish div and a breakdown of support therefore not a bullish div
--
RSI-INFO: BTC example 210523
RSI-INFO: 12H: potential bullish div forming
RSI-INFO: 1D: ackward/invalid as not enough candles (only 4)
-
RSI-INFO: Huge sell off (210519) would expect to see some slow down in the selling via D1 rsi bullish div (they were not, so expect lower lows eventually)
-
RSI-INFO: Huge sell off (210519): On D1, can see ADA RSI has not fallen as much relative to other coins - would therefore expect more lows. But cannot short the lows, there is H4 supply so can look to short that.
-
RSI-INFO: How does RSI print bullish div? It's about how heavy PA has sold off. Look for a reduction of the selling pressure into the lows (LLs made with less strength).
-
RSI-INFO: A HTF RSI div completes; he'll just market buy (not set limits for a dip)
-
RSI-INFO: rsi divs normally in extremes. If not in extremes, need more confluence. "incredible strenth by market essentially fake-breaks" or they are signs that we're eventually going to turn it around and sell-through".
-
RSI-INFO: He'll take a trade solely on a RSI div
-
RSI-INFO: HTF (eg: 3D) divs indicate trend reversals
RSI-INFO: LTF (eg: H4) divs are for bounces
--
RSI-INFO: His biggest overall PnL comes from H4 divs
-
RSI-INFO: RSI 50 level in HTF trending markets is a good entry level
-
RSI-INFO: If RSI is hovering below 50, expect bearish continuation
RSI-INFO: If RSI is hovering above 50, expect bullish continuation 
-
RSI-INFO: Can NEVER assume div will occur, must wait for lock in
RSI-INFO: H4 div should provide a reasonable bounce, don't need to immediately buy on candle close, let it play out a bit first.
-
RSI-INFO: RSI correcting while price holds is bullish
--
211123 daily update 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH8ATbPIDpo&t=2s
ALICE-H1-WANING: div even though mostly not in extreme
ALICE-H1-WANING: "cbs-LTF-rsi-div-not-in-extreme-X"
ALICE-H1-WANING: Again, LTF, less strict on div being in extreme
ALICE-H1-WANING: Div not in extreme shows weakness in trend, not a reversal, but a possible relief bounce ("waning momentum")
SAND-m15-RUN: "a running div" with much more than 14 candles
SAND-m15-RUN: "declining momentum and then correction"
SAND-m15-RUN: zoom to m30 and it becomes a proper div
SAND-m15-RUN: rsi "running div" peaks all lower than previous
SAND-m15-RUN: Tower: regions of consolidation (all time frames) that results in favourable RSIs (all time frames) is very bullish 
--
RSI-50: In a STRONG market, there will be a bounce at the RSI 50 level. So if no bounce, then that market isn't strong
--
CHAD: If coin is straight chadding / trending, bear divs in extremes won't work. Must have context with PA
--
RSI-INFO: Use RSI to TP on spot holdings
RSI-INFO: RSI W1 & D3: how much upside left until overbought?
--
RESET: RSI resetting after a pump:
RESET: A choppy region (range, chop-acc-up, chop-acc-down) will be needed to reset the RSI (come from overbought to 50 level) 
--
STOCH: He used to use StochRSI, helps with timing, doesn't use anymore
--
WRAP-AROUND: RSI wrap-around: curving just above 50 level and then back down again is bearish when price action does the same
--
SR-BETTER-THAN-RSI: SR levels first and RSI second!! SR levels more important than RSI
-
HIDDEN-DIVS-RUBBISH: Hidden divs are total trash
All hidden divs do is put you on the wrong side of trending market


TERMINOLOGY: Extended (in extreme); room for further expansion
TERMINOLOGY: In good shape for continuation up (room to expand)
TERMINOLOGY: Rotating (curling)
TERMINOLOGY: Good for RSI to have AO "AGREEMENT" (eg: bear div on RSI and wanning AO momentum is AO agreement)
TERMINOLOGY: "Thought process"
TERMINOLOGY: "extension point" heading up to extreme to create 
TERMINOLOGY: RSI full rotation to the upside (from oversold to overbought)
TERMINOLOGY: RSI rotation to the downside (from overbought to oversold)
TERMINOLOGY: Full continuation down still (lost 50, still heading to oversold)
TERMINOLOGY: Full continuation up still (claimed 50, still heading to overbought)
TERMINOLOGY: The worry is AO may just give a small nubben above zero line then another full rotation to the downside
TERMINOLOGY: Thought process
TERMINOLOGY: Cool off (on RSI)
TERMINOLOGY: APPRECIATION of market conditions
TERMINOLOGY: Alignment
TERMINOLOGY: Exhaustion rally into bear divs
TERMINOLOGY: Calls a channel deviation an "overthrow" TERMINOLOGY: "cbs-channel-overthrow-deviation-examples1.JPG"
TERMINOLOGY: discussion point
TERMINOLOGY: very extended RSI, hyper extended RSI
TERMINOLOGY: loss of 50 (start dropping below it)
TERMINOLOGY: rejecting from 50 (down "bounce" from 50)
TERMINOLOGY: bouncing from 50 (up bounce from 50)

DOMINO: RSI can have domino effects on different timeframes.
DOMINO: H1 bull div, H4 bouncing 50, D1 & D3 plenty room to expand up
DOMINO: Can have relative domino effect. Market dumping, but coinX hasn't dumped as much with H4 below 50 room to extend down further, H12 crossing below 50, D1 & D3 rotating strong to the downside (even though above 50) indicates coinX has strong potential to dump to the same level as the rest of the market.
DOMINO: Make sure no time-frame (HTF) has a bear div on recent highs (as it may not have played out yet, the 50 resets may have further to drop) 

TRIPLE-DIVS: should ALWAYS ASSUME triple divs, build positions fluidly based on this assumption

TRIPLE-DIVS: No more than 14 candles between each peak of the triple div, not 14 candles for the whole triple div structure
"cbs-triple-divs-can-be-more-than-14-candles-1.jpg"

AGREEMENT: Much better to have AO agreement with a RSI div. Doesn't need to be a matching 
 div, but at least AO momentum ("waning momentum") must be in agreement with the RSI div

TRENDLINES: These show momentum (loma gradients), playing TL breakouts is momentum shift plays

AO: He uses Awesome Indicator as it is slower (34 period) whereas RSI is 14 period. Awesome is not as quick as RSI. So AO: Awesome gives him a good idea of "slow down (in momentum) through a region". Awesome "cleaner in tracking over longer timeframes".
AO: "You will see the divergence better on Renko and the Awesome Indicator will work well".
AO: "The awesome oscillator is interchangeable with RSI"
AO: AO is slower so a bit more reliable in div printing than RSI, but since slower, may miss some divs
AO: RSI is faster than AO
AO-SWING: It was HTF AO back-testing that gave CBS confidence to become a swing trader
AO: A tiny cross over below then back above 0 is bullish 
AO: A tiny cross over above then back below 0 is bearish

DUMP: When market is dumping, check 15m chart. Are bullish divs getting nuked? Don't try and long if they are!
DUMP: Eg: clear bullish div (3x) normally free money... don't stand in the way of the market when it's like this. Don't long.

RESET-OR-IN-MOTION: Full RSI resets to 50 are the best, but when market is strong, may not be granted a FULL rsi reset on high time-frames (eg: drop to 57 RSI is a market "in motion")

***
*** CBS general thoughts
***
CLEAN: He uses very "clean" timeframes
CLEAN: 1M, 1W, 3D, 1D, 4H, 1H, 15m, 5m, 1m
-
SCALPER: He was a tick scalper (renko)
SCALPER: Only uses PA (not scalping now; swing trading); only cares about how much price has moved
SCALPER: https://coldbloodedtraders.com/
SCALPER: He was initially just a scalper (ETH scalping only for 12 months)
SCALPER: Scalping mindset too much; cannot leave PC; cannot switch off PC
SCALPER: Switched to swing after became a dad
SCALPER: Scalpers use vLTF and play both sides of a range. Ranging environments best for scalpers.
SCALPER: Trending markets are not good for scalpers (21006)
SCALPER: Renko is a "tick chart", based only on "dollar value moved", it's not based on time. TPO / MP is a "tick chart" too.
SCALPER: Sclping timeframes; whatever works best for you (1m, 3m, 5m, 10m, 12m, 15m, etc, etc).
SCALPER: Renko needs a premium account on TradingView.
SCALPER: Renko for scalping (no time-frame) with divergences
Got to be more aggresive when scalping
SCALPER: We use Awesome Oscillator (not RSI!) with Renko
SCALPER: Traditional brick size 300 for BTC
SCALPER: RSI momentum plays are what he did as a scalper

-
PA: What makes a bear market
PA: Lose of MS on HTF is what CBS uses to determine bear market (use line chart; open/closes only for MS)
PA: On daily, need to close above 60k to take the KEY high
-
LEARNING: Don't need books, just watch CryptoCred on Youtube
ONCHAIN: On Chain Analysis are cunts
ONCHAIN: On chain analysis is dog shit (because they are always wrong; they were saying can never go below 50k (crashed to 30k))
ONCHAIN: On chain is just a fad like EW, divergence, Wycoff, price action, order blocks; now just on chain's turn to be the fad
PA: He uses market structure (not OBs)
PA: He uses the candle closes to draw PA divs, not highs/lows (unlike Ducc)
-
INDICATORS: Only indicators he uses are RSI and awesome indicator (see his renko charts).
-
HAVEN: He's joined Haven crypto group; $250 per month
- (210606 stream Awesome Indicator first 20 mins)
-
NOT-EXTREME: Bearish divergence occurring below 70 is unusual and normally sign of market-wide selloff. Can say probability of this div being invalidated is high and trade it as such
-
14CANDLES: RSI divs should play out in about 14 candles max
There is no minimum number of candles needed though for divs
14CANDLES: But peaks shouldn't be too close together but no official minimum amount of candles
14CANDLES: Div confimred when div occurs on peaks and then locked in when candle closes confirming "clean peaks"
-
BO-TRADER: Spot and "proper trades"
BO-TRADER: Getting in on retests are MEMES
BO-TRADER: Close above SR market enter a long
BO-TRADER: Close below SR market enter a short
BO-TRADER: Enter 50% on close above level
BO-TRADER: Enter 50% on retest of level (better average entery) but may never get this retest
BO-TRADER: SL below the start of the impulse
BO-TRADER: Impulse should be MSB/pattern break and RSI good too (rsi div, 50 retest or break above 50)

DOX: He's not based in London
DOX: He's currently based in Cardiff
DOX: He tells people he is a "trader", but keeps it surface level.
DOX: Doesn't say he spends 8 hours a day looking for divergences to position into futures contracts.
DOX: But even his close friends don't know that he's CBS (his wife does).

RELATIONS: Alts v. Btc relationship
RELATIONS: ALT/USDT: need BTC to slowly go higher to do well
RELATIONS: ALT/BTC: need BTC to go sideways a bit then up slowly

QQQ: 210519: Nasdaq QQQ:
QQQ: 1M bear div playing out to potentially correct
QQQ: Only convirmed end May
QQQ: Took 2-3 red months to play out
QQQ: SPX & DOW not as bad; each leg up higher momentum
QQQ: each leg up less momentum

210523 BalPerp 
BALPERP: Looks at D1: "no Divs so I can't play anything on the daily"
BALPERP: Looks at H4: "Extends too far past these points here so no valid div present".
BALPERP: It was an M structure (L, HL, LL) so final leg is HL to LL so not valid (even though the L to LL would be valid, cannot ignore the HL (middle point of the M))

210523 LinkPerp 
LINKPERP: Very simple, when link into D1 oversold RSI, good buy opportunity

210523 Metals
METALS: He really likes metals right now (gold / silver and palladium)
METALS: Metals are less volatile than crypto; perhaps easier to trade for newbies
METALS: (1h47m) Silver 6 year consolidation breakout to 1 year consolidation (weekly)... 50+ target
METALS: Platform he uses for traditionals: CMC & Sasko bank

210606:
MS: Different people have different criteria for what is a bull or bear market. He uses market structure, others will use MA (eg: 200ma)
TRIANGLE: Symmetrical triangle will break more often in the direction of the trend. Downtrend = down, uptrend = up.
CANDLESTICK: "He thinks candle-stick patterns are horse-shit"
NEWS: In a strong uptrend (bull), bad news will get shrugged off and good news will get a strong reaction
NEWS: In a strong downtrend (bear), good news will get shrugged off and bad news will get a strong reaction

EXECUTION: "Support is support UNTIL it's not." 
"Resistance is resistance UNTIL it's not."
EXECUTION: Don't be afraid to take action incase it breaks; don't second guess it; take your precautionary action AFTER it fails
EXECUTION: Wait until price moves away from demand / supply to enter (ie: make sure it has been established first)
EXECUTION: Don't anticipate buying on retest; wait for confirmation that retest is support zone.

JOURNAL: Use your own discord server as you can paste tradingview charts in there and easily keep notes (entry, SL, exit, emotional state etc).

PSYCH: Mental state: You can "work" trading 60 hours a week and lose $5000. Imagine working normal job 60 hours per week and paying your boss $5k for your hard work.
PSYCH: Don't care about today or this week. Care about where you are in 5 years.

HODL: He doesn't like holding any crypto in a downtrend (so he's not yield-farming right now, although he would like to be yield farming).

RANDOM: Marking a range, he marks with candle closes (made with renko or line charts)
RANDOM: swing failure pattern is just a sweep ("we've taken the highs but closed below == sweep)
RANDOM: CBS is regarded as a "professional trader" so he is allowed to trade on FTX (classification of pro).
RANDOM: "Strength is the reclaiming of significant levels"
RANDOM: For stocks, looks to TP at HTF bearish divs.
RANDOM: He doesn't use log charts, doesn't use open interest
RANDOM: He likes Wycoff as an underlying theory, not for signals
RANDOM: Never FOMO into news related pumps; they retrace quickly.
RANDOM: He sorts watchlist by percentage change to get big movers
RANDOM: If a breakdown is happening on HTF, we can spot it coming on LTF
RANDOM: Be wary of longing diagonal breakouts straight into horizontal resistance
RANDOM: After large impulse (eg: down), it takes time for whales to exit positions (iceberg orders at support) so it will chop / range for a bit as they do this.
RANDOM: Also, other whales will start buying in order to build long position at support (iceberg orders)
RANDOM: Retail are expecting huge recovery of impulse and will get rinsed / chopped up as their emotions are heightened and discord / CT / telegram is blowing up 

GRADING: A, B, C, D grade trades
GRADING: A grade: HTF RSI div into HTF support with AO confluence 
GRADING: D grade: retest of support

SWING-TRADER: Comfortable being underwater & knowing not instantly in profit.
SWING-TRADER: If scalper, you want to be instantly in profit or you need to get out of trade.
SWING-TRADER: Swing trading needs more patience than scalping.
SWING-TRADER: Swing trading needs less time at PC than scalping
SWING-TRADER: Swing trades should last days to months
SWING-TRADER: Swing trading crypto is tough (see EGLD). Best to use spot
SWING-TRADER: Binance and FTX allow spot shorting (margin)

Introduction to Divergences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR1slopvFoQ
He doesn't like hidden divs
- they tend to mask proper divs when trading into them
- wrong side of trade
- against the momentum actually coming through
Indication to market changing, momentum change
LOCKED IN: twin peaks (rsi bearish div)
LOCKED IN: rsi rise, peak, fall, rise, lower peak, FALL
LOCKED IN: two DISTINCT peaks on candle close = LOCKED IN
ENTRY: take 50% position on candle lock-in
ENTRY: next 50% of position on move out of extreme
ENTRY: entry positions like this as may be triple-drive (3x) and we're countering the trend (like harmonics)
When can we say the div has played out?
PLAYED-OUT: End to end plays (extreme to extreme)
PLAYED-OUT: Bear div candles will have PA lows, close when these taken
PLAYED-OUT: Close on a significant move in our favour (big candle, especially if this takes out bear div candle lows
PLAYED-OUT: Close if cross from below to above 50 level
PLAYED-OUT: Apply these closing strategies to time-frames <D3
PLAYED-OUT: HTF (D3, W, M) divs indicate full trend reversals and will have much further targets to aim for
SMALL-RSI-GAPS are POOR divs (tight divs are ineffective)
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: check lower time-frames for proper div
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: if tight RSI on H1, try 15m for proper div and trade as 15m setup (ie: a quicker more aggressive setup than H1)
SMALL-RSI-GAPS: want approx 9,10,11,12,13,14 candles for divs
LONG-DIVS-3X: if long triple div, check a higher time-frame
LONG-DIVS-3X: proper div setup (2 peaks) should be there
LONG-DIVS-3X: long triple div on 15m? check H1 and adjust trade accordingly
LONG-DIVS-3X: want approx 9,10,11,12,13,14 candles for divs
Many retail "need" to be in a position so MMs just need

Context. Wait (patience) for lock-in. Don't mess with RSI unless in extremes (exception uber trends)

Momentum with RSI video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AECBV8y0prc
- RSI is a measure of MOMENTUM (remember this)
- These RSI plays can be implemented on any time-frame
BREAK-50: Above 50 = bullish
BREAK-50: Below 50 = bearish
BREAK-50: Breaking through 50 level is SIGNIFICANT achievement for momentum; trade with the momentum (& trend)
BREAK-50: The 50-level decides who is winning the market tug-of-war (bulls or bears)
SR-50: HTF *trending* market, expect 50 to act as retest support. 50 level will not be support in ranging market
SR-50: We're looking for clear trending environments for 50 retests (good for trend joining (get in on HL) or keeping positions open)
MSB&50-CROSS: Break MS & break RSI 50 = new trend
MSB&50-CROSS: HTF trening market (eg: D1)
MSB&50-CROSS: Break MS (eg: HH) and RSI breaks above 50 = bullish momentum
MSB&50-CROSS: Instead of a MSB, it could be a pattern (diagonal / channel / etc) with rsi crossing above 50
SR-50: If downtrend, 50-level will act as resistace from below.
SR-50: If uptrend, 50-level will act as support from above.
SR-50: A lot of CBS trades is ANTICIPATING RSI breaking through the 50-level (confluent with a S/R level (MSB) too)
SR-50: Like MAs when the trend is too strong (won't touch the MA; it'll front run it) RSI will also front-run the 50-level if the trend is too strong
50&MA-GAPS: RSI monitors momentum in trending markets (like moving averages gaps)
50&MA-GAPS: MA big gap = strong trend (HH & HL)
50&MA-GAPS: MA compression = potential trend reversal
50&MA-GAPS: Bounce off 50 = momentum still strong (HH, HL)
50&MA-GAPS: Lose 50 level after a holding a long time significant (especially with bearish MSB too)
EXTREMES: Look at historical amount of time in overbought and oversold to gauge momentum of coin

LTF tips and tricks scalping video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYLACPfqx7s&t=103s

Big breakthrough for him was completely FLUID position building (not all in on one entry (eg: 2x div), instead start build entry but allow the possibility of 3x div).

FLUID position building changes MINDSET from defensive / negative to aggressive / positive (AGGRESIVE POSITION BUILDING)

Most people intra-day trading use 5m charts
Div still valid? Don't worry about time. Build FLUID position
Div not valid anymore? Close position
Build FLUID position without worrying about time.

Diagonal breakouts
Need BULLISH MS (uptrend)to play bullish breakouts
Need BEARISH MS (downtrend)to play bearish breakouts

Usually after a big impulse from a div, it will consolidate for a while (not impulse straight back in a V recovery). You will have time, don't rush.

ALICE & AXS tend to CONSOLIDATE then pop. If you see consolidation, watch for the pop.

Playing Divergences - TA Help with FTX (not from The Haven)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QUsgSZneY
RANGES: Playing divs within ranges is great
RANGES: Bear div into range-high / resistance, great
RSI-WEAK: Appreciate market conditions (eg: impulse BO of 2 month consolidation range into a large uptrend, don't short bear divs, try and get in on HLs of the new uptrend)
RSI-WEAK: flip the logic, look for bullish divergences
RSI-WEAK: If market strongly up-trending or down-trending don't use rsi divs, they are weak and it's what gives rsi a bad name (rsi meme)
MORE-14-CANDLES: huge ETH uptrend and bearish divs... continuous price HHs & continous rsi LHs gives one huge bear div much more than 14 candles (not good though as ETH is trending up hard and divs no use in massive trending markets)

RSI - How I use it & Advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dbRcZh_AHY&t=92s
Momentum indicator
- BO opportunities
- join in on the trend
- divs aligned with macro trend stronger
- counter trend div be more aggressive with TPs
14-CANDLES: If number of candles creating div exceeds 14 then it's not valid.
14-CANDLES: He doesn't completely stick to this rule but very good guidance for him
50-LEVEL: 50-level is a reset button for rsi (fresh start)
50-LEVEL: retest, cool off from or join existing trend
50-LEVEL: tells us (1) price cooled from strong trend an 50 point is natural resting place OR it's telling you price is ranging
50-LEVEL: CBS likes H4 best for analysing cooling off periods
50-LEVEL: Strong uptrend then cool off into extreme oversold then he's interested, then seeing cross above 50 very interested
50-LEVEL: he doesn't want to mess with asset chopping around 50 as this indicates indecision
MEME: "divergences can't be trusted in the trend"
MEME: need to use RSI in context with PA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0edhH20a-Uo  (Haven chill video)
Loma success: High conviction alt plays that you rotate around with good PA.
1-to-1 he teaches feels he's chasing all the time
Proactive plays, position ahead of time, wait for the pop... THEY ALWAYS COME!
Most are looking at the big pops now and wanting to chase / FOMO things that are popping (asking on the stream when to join the lastet pumping coin)
Ignore the noise

CBS Q&A/Chill (Whale discord group, his age, portfolio 70% crypto, 30% stable)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCtMraw1q20
211026: his wife doesn't work and he's in his early 30s
Whales don't really do TA, it's psycology and timing the trend (trendlines)
His one-to-one lessons want to grow account NEXT WEEK, not SIX MONTHS time; sense of time huge time.
He's 30% in stablecoins right now
DefiGod approach is 2x on shitcoin then rotate to main ecosystem coin
3D rsi has room to expand
When everything looks good can be warning sign
-If everthing bullish and HTF RSI extended, watch out
-Check HTF to see if room for RSI to grow (D3 & W1 room to grow, D1 reset, then good for spot swing trade)
NFTs dead right now, he's in NFT hibernation, crypto market looks good for swinging now
CBS doesn't talk about tax tips
Finish up: 
MAIN THINK: DON'T OVER-COMPLICATE THIS PROCESS
DON'T THINK TOO DEEP INTO THE CHARTS (just look for pullbacks / retests)
WE KNOW AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO BE A LARGE SELL OFF
HAVE CAPITAL READY TO DEPLOY FOR THIS

--CBS Chilling 211108
His biggest breakthrough in trading was just trusting the trend (momentum) and not overcomplicating things
-
His spot portfolio big potential with a bigger portion of his portfolio (5% to 10%)
BIG POSITION: weekly divs (very rare - alchamix)
BIG POSITION: weekly rsi reset with retest of support
-
He doesn't use Fibs, doesn't like them, complicate things
Use HTF (minimum D3 for HTF) divs for taking profit in price discovery, not Fibs
His style is simple. RSI & horizontal-SR levels
RSI gives him momentum in his favour and lets market carry him
His horizontal-SR levels are technically "supply and demand zones"
His method works on legacy (stonks) very well, even easier
RSI reset is about 50 (perhaps down to 45ish OK)
Some ALTs will reset at specific levels not necessarily 50
-
High APY pools CBS is in: OHM, Climber, TIME, SPELL
OHM looks most promising
Spell & Ice he really believes in (cross-chain / bridges all in 1 solution from single source)
Spell & Ice has great community / cult, very important in crypto
Speel is "going after MKR Maker"
-
Swing trader needs patience, comfy underwater
Scalper needs market to move immediately (tiny SL)
-
Can never confirm a double top until it starts to move away from it (locks in)
Always look at the market from a bullish perspective
Where can I buy to make money
-
The longer the consolidation, the bigger the breakout
-
Use RSI to TP on spot
RSI W1 & D3: how much upside left until overbought?
-
Farming pool 14 days month ago everything just ticking over
All his farms reached full rewards now
-
Adam Lambert:
?"I am really interested in the farming [STAKING] stuff, but worry that my portfolio is too small for it to be worthwhile... and there are better ops elsewhere to grow it"
CBS:
Yes, 100%, better ops elsewhere
Need >100k to farm these "soft" investment, keep money just ticking over
If want to grow your portfolio, play the market, rotate through the ecosystems, play for the airdrops using alts
-
He's 9x up on his FTX degen account
-
The market is easyish (bullish) right now.
Psycology is the hardest part.
All the setups we've been looking at are simple:
RSI 50 touches or SR flips and you BUY
Don't worry about learning TA in a bull market; keep it very simple. Learn TA in a bear market.
Bear market PA is slower, more chop.
Bull market PA is aggressive and violent.
Plenty of opportunity all over
CBS taking heavy profit on ETH at 5k
OK if it pumps further, have to realise profit then rotate into other oppertunities
A big of it is NOT looking at your spot / hodl
-
Degen
One wrong mistake on 20x lev whole portfolio and fcukd
Good to go heavy on a couple of coins (conviction) rather than spread yourself 10% into 10 diff coins
-
Keep your spot on ledger as it makes it hard to panic sell

cbs-Bull-Market-Up-trending-Tips-and-Advice-notPussyBitch
Ignore twitter and discord (& telegram)
Use HTF charts, mark out significant levels (everything else LTF chop in a bull market)
Red day: You look at how far it can go down
Green day: You look at how far it can go up
HTF levels are the most important levels we have
Just give it a chance to go up and it will
Dictate by HTF levels, not H4 / 15m charts
Don't think reasons why bull market must end
TP, making good money USD on the move after 1 month
It COULD go higher
But there is opportunity EVERYWHERE
TPing doesn't mean you're frozen out of the market
BULL MARKET: Don't let your emotion lead you
BULL MARKET: Don't dive into the LTF charts

CHOP: After an impulse move, there is chop for a while.
CHOP: Don't over analyse; step away from the charts
CHOP: You'll lose the most money in the chop
TREND: D1 and higher is HTF for CBS
TREND: Use line chart
STABLE: He uses USDC, he doesn't use USDT (currenly 45% stable, 55% crypto)
STABLE: No liquidity issue with USDC 
STYLE: He's a momentum swing trader
STYLE: tries to anticipate when the momentum is coming (turning around or breaking out)
When a consolidation comes to an end, when bullish / bearish momentum is going to take over
He's not an order-block trader, he uses supply and demand regions which are very similar to OBs (doesn't classify himself an OB trader)
FARMS: Doesn't touch them, they're earning
FARMS: OHM, earning 6% every 5 days, can withstand drawdown
Productive asset, so more grace, a little bit of protection
FARMS: High APY farms (ponzinomics) tend to nuke..
FARMS: why not OHM & TIME?..
FAMRS: ..single side stake protocols, huge volume, different model to rest
FARMS: Normally, high APY farms dual pair (LPs) open to price swings, IL (impermenant loss)
FARMS: Single side staking is much more comfortable
FARMS: OHM is where CBS filters his higher risk staking profits to 
FARMS: OHM & TIME are blue-chip original forks, best to keep adding to the blue-chips
PSYCH: Figure out what is worst case sell off that is very aggresive and goes to a lower level than most think possible, especially when there is a HTF (weekly) div on the token
PSYCH: If planned for this in advance (W1 bearish divs can give very strong reactions), can then buy with a plan

Twitch midweek stream 211118:
He's NOT based in London
TRADER: He uses discord for journaling his trades, btc, eth, alts, htf, ltf, scalps
TRADER: Hodlers are better off sticking to spot after success, you're not a trader, you're an investor in a speculative market
TRADER: D1, D3 & W1 are his most used levels (as a momentum swing trader)
TRADER: Emotion control is way more important than TA; you need to be able to "pull the trigger"
KNIFE: Likes to buy into strength (will wait to buy high on SR reclaim & good RSI)
KNIFE: Doesn't like to knife catch (demand zones?)
KNIFE: Doesn't like to buy into weakness (demand zones?)
BTC-SHORTING: He doesn't short BTC, if BTC going down, alts will go down more, so short alts
BTC-SHORTING: He will take a large short position so he is *net short* on his spot portfolio (25min)
BTC-SHORTING: "Going to hedge a % of the portfolio against this AXS short trade"
BTC-SHORTING: close down some of the spot exposure too
BTC-SHORTING: Net short so he can get out of awkward positions
BTC-SHORTING: Little trimming of positions and hedge short to manage portfolio
TRADER: He *would not* just blindly buy support (eg: weekly demand); need a div with it
TRADER: Been trading full time for 4 years, only indicator he needs is RSI; need to backtest in order fully understand
TRADER: Never fail to TP into HTF resistance; there will be another play if it goes higher
TRADER: Management of emotions, especially when you have great entry, is very difficult (to take profit)

D3 timeframe is great intersection between the daily and the weekly; very good for swing trades
Cooling off of RSI (ready for another leg up; like HL HH structure, this is a ROTATION up)
Watch what pumps on big green days: L1S, L1-ats, NFT gaming, metaverse (don't say "it didn't pump much so it will soon")
Analysis and charting knowledge can be a curse; analysis paralysis. Just press the green button and go away, tokens going up 40% a day. Fomo is sometimes a good feeling to follow
TOWER only game with millions of downloads yet has a low market cap; CBS aiming for another 10x ($1)
Gaia & Atlas possible new games to look at.
Compounding swings; don't fomo as it ruins average entry, wait for retest/strength of key level (SR)

His favorite plays are HTF divs
Trading is like gambling; addictive
Especially LTF, scalping, worry about missing out on impulses as you may only get one a day (and if you miss it you'll assume that you would have played it perfectly (and you wouldn't))
Swing trading is healthier for him, gives him breaks
It got to the point where he couldn't even enjoy video games (he oves video games) all his time was taken reading charts
There is always something giving great opportunity, don't rush it.
Manage risk; don't over-leverage (check charts too much).
Slow and steady; money begets money. How efficiently are you spending time? Treat it like a job

RSI HH, HL, HH, HL curl up == "rotation back to upside"
Check weekly to see if run ups have finished (over extended)
Compare coins on the weekly to see which have still got gas in the tank

RSI has "room to expand to the upside"

If token is trending strongly, then 1st areas of demand should be bases for further pushes
BREAK-BEAR-DIV: Unusual place to confirm bear div (1st peak in overbought, second not in extreme)..

SF research AO by 
AO crossing the 0 line == RSI crossing 50 level
AO div lock-in (bar color change) == RSI lock-in
AO reset 0 line == RSI 50 reset
AO also has saucer strategy (enter after momentum pullback)
SAUCER STRAT: bars above zero, bars mostly green
SAUCER STRAT: at least 2 red bars (could be >2)
SAUCER STRAT: enter on confirmation of next green bar
SAUCER STRAT: catching the retest of a trending coin

AO: Momentum indicator
AO: Slower than RSI 
AO: Not as quick to deliver xovers or divs as RSI..
AO: ..but is usually MORE ACCURATE than RSI  
AO: Difference between 34MA & 5MA; plots the difference

AO: works on any time-frame
ABVBELOW: Look at all AO time spend above & below..
ABVBELOW: ..0 line, where AO spends most of its..
ABVBELOW: ..time is the prevailing trend
XOVER: most simple strategy
XOVER: zero level (treat same as 50 on RSI)
XOVER: above0=bullish, below0=bearish
XOVER: As AO is slower than RSI, xovers are significant
XOVER: Just longing a cross over above 0 gives..
XOVER: ..good entry to trending markets
DIVS: use AO peaks just like RSI line for divs
DIVS: use lower AO PEAKS (bull div)
DIVS: use 2 bars of opposite colour (green) to confirm PEAKS
DIVS: (peak extreme can be one or more bars (red))
DIVS: (div locked-in after 2 bars of opposite colour (green))
DIVS: 2 bars for lock-in as it's difficult to reverse from

SWING: CBS highly recommends, lots of info presented simply
SWING: Playing HTF divs was how he started developing..
SWING: ..a swing trading appetite and process
SWING: HTF divs on AO are "wonderful signals"
--
(i) macro trend: look back, mostly above or below 0 line?
(ii) xovers
(iii) divs

-- Krillin info on AO (members-questions 211218)
My take as an MA trader is that AO divergences are simply another way to read MAs flattening without displaying MAs on your chart
AO is the simply the gap between MA5 and MA34
MA34 on 12h is 4h MA100 and on daily that 4h MA200
Since I like MA100 a lot more than MA200 i'd naturally prefer 12h divergences

Full Member Question Video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RTlkjElA04
RSI50: "cbs-rsi-50-level-bounces-and-PA-bounces.png"
RSI50: 50 level is not exact, it's a rough level
RSI50: 50 level should be used WITH PA together
RSI50: a PA triangle is CONSOLIDATION area
RSI50: The reason RSI is above the 50 is PA is trending up, but cool off of uptrend  ("dump" or consolidation) resets RSI
RSI50: Look for impulse breaking pa consolidation AND RSI breaking above or bouncing off 50 for uptrend continuation
RSI50: Result = PA impulse WITH momentum on it's side going WITH the trend
RSI-SR: "cbs-take-profit-using-momentum1.png"
RSI-SR: "How to use RSI with support and resistance"
RSI-SR: Combo of 50 level and DIAGONALS (diagonal = selloff or dump)
RSI-SR: "important PA event with an important RSI event" means a good signal IF we're at PA SR level; double confluence
RSI-SR: When looking for breakouts, RSI 50 level most important as gives biggest liklihood of most value (ride it to overbought)
FOLIO: Min stable he'll go to is 20% of portfolio, he'll never have a lower percentage of stable than this 
FOLIO: Min 20% stable, not to be a buyer, but so he's not fully invested in ponzi (crypto) tokens
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: He doesn't have stops on small COSMOS ecosystem coins, SCRT, SIENNA, etc, these can go up and down 30% a day, MUCH SMALLER POSITION SIZE, try and get xMultiple returns, don't worry about invalidation on these plays, his invalidation is COSMOS dieing, he's playing COSMOS for the future
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: He waited 3 months to be up 60% on COSMOS, now everyone is asking about his invalidation
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: Need to have a dollar amount willing to lose and multiple hoping to gain (this is the risk management for alt plays)
FOLIO-SIZE-RISK: All questions about fear, invalidation levels of COSMOS, not one question about upside targets on the strongest ecosystem from the lows; overexposed=FEAR
HIDDEN: Hidden divs are absolute bollocks
HIDDEN: They are the worst because you'll very often go against a very strong move in the other direction and wreck you (see March 2021 example, both hidden bull div and normal bear div)
BO: You have to be a market-buyer when playing a breakout (not a limit buyer) 
BO: Market buyer 100% or 50% now and 50% lower down (retest)
BO: SL has to be below the impulse candle
SL-MOMENTUM: Always a tight stop with RSI breakout plays
SL-MOMENTUM: Clear invalidations (LL invalidates)
SL-MOMENTUM: Playing into momentum / impulse
SL-MOMENTUM: Timeframes of his official trades are H1, or lower, H4 at most - timing the market to go up right now, so need very tight SL
SL-MOMENTUM: H1, want in the 2, 3 or 4 hours
SL-MOMENTUM: Using 50 cross, AO cross, impulse now or I'm
SL-MOMENTUM: Really just about RSI 50 cross (or AO cross); NOT about the PA horizontal levels
COSMOS: Don't stake on Keplr (21 day bonding), stake in Osmosis pools (1 day bonding, same APR)
COSMOS: Posted a monthly chart, ask him in 3 to 6 months (time needed to for monthly chart play out)

===== Hedging
"cbs-luna-short-hedge-rsi-analysis1-hedge-all-spot-positions.JPG"
DOMINOES: RSI falling dominoes; chain reaction
DOMINOES: H4 low but not in oversold
DOMINOES: H12 rotating below the 50
DOMINOES: D1 peeking below the 50
DOMINOES: D3 above the 50 but pointing down
DOMINOES: W1 above the 50 but pointing down
DOMINOES: Because H4, H12, D1 have bad RSI, we expect them to drag D3 and W1 below the 50 too (not bounce at 50)
If you can get your short hedges (luna) outperforming your spot holdings this is very good in a down-market
DOMINOES: Make sure no time-frame (HTF) has a bear div on recent highs (as it may not have played out yet, the 50 resets may have further to drop) 
--
Hedge all or a good portion of spot positions with an alt (or two) that looks bad;
hopefully the bad looking alts dump as much (or more) than our spot positions
--
$10000 of spot holdings
$10000 short position on luna

LONGS: Stop looking for longs
LONGS: Slow and get removed quickly (unwind in half the time)
LONGS: Up moves are slow grinds up, then unwind quickly down
LONGS: "Stairs up, elevator down"
LONGS: AO is showing reducing momentum in grinds up
TARGET: aim for fresh lows (take previous low then new low)
POWER: All the power comes from the trending down direction
POWER: Slow grind up then quick impulse down
EARLY: Don't close trade early
EARLY: Don't worry about the slow grind back up eating your profits, let the market work for you, don't over-trade
SCANNING: Look weekly RSI, which coin is at the highest level
SCANNING: These coins have the furthest to fall
SCANNING: RSI bearish falling dominoes (chain reaction)
SCANNING: Which coin has furthest to fall
SCANNING: Luna is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Atom is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Crv is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Bnb is a catostophy chart (tipping point, lowest RSI in 2 years)
SCANNING: Near is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Ftm is a catostophy chart
SCANNING: Look at lower time-frames for entries
SCANNING: Look for lower time-frames divergences
SCANNING: If you get the divergences, then look for the lows
SCANNING: If in longs, take money off table quickly or market will obliterate you in seconds
SCANNING: Before, CBS said AO on H12 & D1 for crypto (fast moving market)

OPTIONS: Options are easier psychologically to manage
OPTIONS: Defined risk & no need to set a SL
OPTIONS: In volatility, where to set SL on spot hold?
OPTIONS: So easier with options, most people would do better with options
OPTIONS: Daily div, would take long time to play out, no way you only take one trade and don't take multiple in the chop
OPTIONS: Daily div, gie yourself a wide enough expiry (~45 days)
OPTIONS: So many people have the right idea when it comes to trades, biggest issue is management (eg: PnL down $200, so cut trade). Easy risk and trade management
OPTIONS: Like betting shop, set and forget it
OPTIONS: eg: $500 on other degen plays that did 30x
OPTIONS: eg: 1600 calls now, $3000, for 2 days away, price $1550, he's 1500 up (still below strike price but 50% up)
OPTIONS: eg: 2200 calls now also 30% up (on the fixed risk)
OPTIONS: very good for HTF div plays
OPTIONS: buy low and can sell / walk-away on the spike up (even though strike price not hit)
OPTIONS: can close the option trade at anytime
OPTIONS: nearly always a buyer: to long we buy calls, to short we buy puts
OPTIONS: 50% back on options fees from referal line, 10% trading fee discount, bonus of up to $30k with CBS referal line
OPTIONS: ?CBS referal code: https://www.delta.exchange?code=cbs
OPTIONS: Get a percentage of your initial deposit as trading credits

===== Identifying Tight Stop Loss Trades for Maximum Returns
Mannequin question became a video ;-)
https://youtu.be/Os_9990AeI8
"CBS-Identifying-Tight-Stop-Loss-Trades-for-Maximum-Returns-mannequin-question-wee.mp4"
INTRO-TITLE: "Tighter stop trades for huge returns"
INTRO-TITLE: "Controlled degen plays"
INTRO-TITLE: This covers a counter-trend play (longing into a HTF down-trend); another video will be made covering going with the trend
INTRO-HTF: Must start looking for these trades on HTF
INTRO-HTF: H4, H12, D1, D3, etc to formulate plan
INTRO-DOMINO: Will be looking for domino RSI effect
INTRO-DOMINO: Will allow us to find entry on LTF
XTZ-DEGEN: "cbs-sensible-degen-plays-mannequin-question1-xtz-D3-bull-div.JPG"
XTZ-DEGEN: Creating a XTZ "sensible degen" trade
XTZ-DEGEN: Looking for big position size (degen) but with very tight SL (hoping to catch impulse away from region)
XTZ-DEGEN: Currently D3 bull divs on AO and RSI
RSI Summary. Now look for triggers
XTZ-DEGEN: D1 revels the SR (under over pattern)
XTZ-DEGEN: D4 tighten the D1 SR locally, reducing height of SR and tightening the trigger region
XTZ-DEGEN: D4 target some local highs D3 bulls divs likely to reach in bear market (20% in this case)
XTZ-DEGEN: Dive into 15m as H1 SL would be too loose
XTZ-DEGEN: Dive into m5, overextended on RSI and no obvious degen SL
XTZ-DEGEN: Back to m15, wait for more PA, small pull back and consolidate, look to catch impulse
XTZ-DEGEN: Can see we could have tried this setup yesterday (and got stopped out), but RR so good we can try again.
REFINING-FOR-BO: Could be an H4 trader, wait for close above H4, SL below H4 recent low.
REFINING-FOR-BO: But we've identified possible confluence for a BO / impulse here, want to (1) be more aggresive (2) anticipate the momentum (3) want to time it with great RR to squeeze up our position size
REFINING-FOR-BO: Want to place out SL (1) below the SR level and (2) below the last consolidation build up
REFINING-FOR-BO: Can slide SL up quickly on these setups
REFINING-FOR-BO: Dynamic trades that move with the PA
HTF-TREND: Keep this in mind, is our play with the overall trend or is it a counter-trend squeeze play - set targets accordingly
SCREEN-TIME-YES: Consolidation under the levels
SCREEN-TIME-YES: m15 RSI rotating back down to the 50 while STILL maintaining pressure on the levels we're wanting to crack
SCREEN-TIME-YES: This is worth us STARING at the screen to watch for impulse
ANSWER-SUMMARY: SL placement always below the LTF (m15) consolidation prior to the break-out
ANSWER-SUMMARY: possible high RR trades needs leg-work on the higher time-frames for anticipation of market BO - **THIS IS THE KEY TO IT**
ANSWER-SUMMARY: Yes, we will get stopped-out trying this as we're trying to jump the gun, trying to be early
ANSWER-SUMMARY: but when we do catch one, we'll do very well - so manage risk
ANSWER-SUMMARY: don't get dis-heartened after 2 stops if the PA is still there!
ANSWER-SUMMARY: PA is still there if (1) price is still chopping against the SR, (2) no bear divs, (3) "cool offs" on RSI to 50 only (via the chop) and (4) no rejections from the SR
ANSWER-SUMMARY: This is the best way to find high RR trades with tight stop losses.
SF-SUMMARY: Counter HTF trend very high RR long squeeze plays
SF-SUMMARY: HTF bull divs (D3)
SF-SUMMARY: SR resistance to break D1
SF-SUMMARY: SR resistance refine H4
SF-SUMMARY: m15 PA chop / consolidate below SR resistance only resetting RSI (cool offs only, no bear divs)
SF-SUMMARY: SL below m15 consolidations try and catch BO / impulse

===== Generic Notes (start)
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: 90% of the time, in a trending market, this breaks upwards with force
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: daily update 1st Nov 2021
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: clear bear div on eth
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: but it's occurring after flip and hold of very important SR level (4200)
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: the TRUE momentum for this move hasn't arrived
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: but also clear invalidation for quick close if wrong

BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE-MQ-QUESTION: "cbs-mq-question-H4-rsi-div-through-resistance1.JPG"
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE-MQ-QUESTION: MQ: H4 bear div breaking through reistanceno
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE-MQ-QUESTION: CBS: no, look at HTF levels for rejections at these levels
BEAR-DIV-THROUGH-RESISTANCE: "cbs-not-a-div-bullish-momentum-yet-to-come.png"

STONKS: Good buying strategy in bull market just buy higher highs
PIERRE: He's been slaying the bear market
PIERRE: Very fluid trader
PIERRE: Keeps HTF trend in mind while trading both sides of the market
RSI-50-m15: On pumping coins, m15 pullbacks to RSI 50 nice entries; target a HH
RSI-50-m15: "cbs-sushi-juicy-ltf-RSI-pullback-on-nice-rsi-domino6.JPG"

COOL-OFF: m15 RSI cools offs can be good entries for pumping coins (in strong trending markets / degen account time)
COOL-OFF: "cbs-ltf-rsi-cool-offs-for-entry.JPG"

TOPS: Increased volatility is usually associated with a top forming
TOPS: Fits with Loma's DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM-SMALLER-PUMPS -  pumps get smaller as retraces get bigger then a HL (these are volatile)

FINDING-COINS-FOR-HIS-METHOD: Look for most pumping and dumping coins each day

CONSOLIDATION-ABV-RESISTANCE: always fantastic setups to take (like SZ)

OVER-EXTEND: Doesn't like to see the market over-extend first, wants it to cool off (reset oscillators), flip SR, THEN extend (like SZ - "if it impulse away, I miss it; if it breaks-consolidates-pumpMSB, then I will have an entry"

MQ-ERRORS: Took a H4 CBS short, but look at the RSI after I was under-water 
MQ-ERRORS: "cbs-trb-short-error-should-have-flipped-long-rsi-great-1-H4.JPG"
MQ-ERRORS: Seeing this, I should have closed and flipped long.
MQ-ERRORS: Also, I just took one entry

SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: Playing a D3 bear div (eg: ETC D3 rsi bear div)
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: Multiple (i) HTF divs at (ii) HTF RESISTANCE (need both)
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: Volatility, hard to stick to LTF positions (chopped out)
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: Volatility happens like this when market about to change direction quickly
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: Continued weakness, markets couldn't push higher on lower timeframe bull divs
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: Understand playing a HTF bear div trying to get LTF entries will get chopped, try again.
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: History of HTF divs like this - they rarely lie and they rarely fail.
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: "cbs-great-performance-HTF-divs1.JPG"
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: CBS was saying in chat that he thought the big impulse down was yet to come; kept trying to get into short via LTF entries
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET: I commented on this myself trying in Ducc's group, H4 harmonics just chop and not M & W patterns
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET-1: HTF bear bivs at HTF resistance
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET-2: Volatility / choppines at this SR
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET-3: Failure of LTF bull divs to push up
SWING-TRADER-MINDSET-4: Rarely lie and rarely fail

DISTRIBUTION: High volatility at HTF resistance
DISTRIBUTION: Sellers slapping down advances
DISTRIBUTION-OPTTION1: rally complete about to sell off
DISTRIBUTION-OPTTION2: blow off top above HTF resistance then sell off
DISTRIBUTION-OPTTION3: wrong, it'll flip HTF resistance to support
DISTRIBUTION: "cbs-volatility-at-resistance-distribution-TRB-1.JPG" 

MARKET-OVERVIEW: If clear/strong m15 bull divs do nothing (no up move) and kind-of/weak m15 bear divs cause pukes, this tells us the market is VERY WEAK

WANING-MOMENTUM: Not a bull div according to CBS's RSI rules, but price making LLs and RSI making HLs is "waning momentum" or a "reduction in momentum".
WANING-MOMENTUM: Perhaps more than 14 candles and not in an extreme so NOT a rsi bull div
WANING-MOMENTUM: May act like a bull div BUT such structures can nuke easily, taking out all the lows (elevator down)

DIV-REJECTION-CANDLES: Div gives an impulse, price meets trend (13/25ema) from below, rejects from there, AO div confirms, then continue impulse
DIV-REJECTION-CANDLES: "aggr-div-playouts-rejection-candles1.png"

DIV-FAILS-TO-FORM: Blacksphere pointed out that a bull div that looks to be forming, but then gets invalidated, will likely give another leg down in price
DIV-FAILS-TO-FORM: "aggr-blacksphere-rsi-invalidated-bull-div-likely-extension-down1.png"

EDGE: CBS's edge is being able to time volatility

DEGEN-INTRO: degen account trading
DEGEN-INTRO: CBS well known for it
DEGEN-INTRO: his degen trading is fully based on his current momentum system (& market understanding)
INTRO: fill account with "throwaway" money, possible to lose it all
IDENTIFICATION: Market tells us likely big moves
IDENTIFICATION: (RP BTC 3-tapped then he opened his degen)
IDENTIFICATION: HTF (D3) divs on ETH and SUSHI, AAVE etc
IDENTIFICATION: HTF must support aggression
IDENTIFICATION: Better to long, many of the alts did 2x, you cannot 2x if shorting (Krill maths behind longs better); gains bigger on long side for degen
IDENTIFICATION: LTF to support the HTF picture (LTF impulse)
IDENTIFICATION: If ETH starts popping, then really good for alts (hard to catch ETH though)
IDENTIFICATION: Everything is moving up
IDENTIFICATION: Don't fade the charts NUMBER 1 RULE
IDENTIFICATION: It's a deviation, IGNORE, FUCK'EM
SIMPLE: Just jump in, low 20-IQ needed - SIMPLE TRIGGERS
SIMPLE: Uses H1 and H4 charts mostly
SIMPLE: SAND triangle BO
SIMPLE: SAND H4 hit triangle resistance, resulting in RSI 50 reset, then impulse away (simple TA)
ANTICIPATE: Can enter in anticipation of BO (appreciation of market conditions, all popping off)
ANTICIPATE: Very tight SL as we're saying "it has to move now"
ANTICIPATE: in 10, 15 or 20 mins we want it to impulse away or we're wrong
COOL-OFFS: In strong trending markets, the m15 RSI 50 should hold, if it doesn't hold, there's a problem with the trend
SUSHI-RSI-DOMINO: Bounced from D1 support
SUSHI-RSI-DOMINO: H4 breaking above 50, H4 AO possible break above zero line
SUSHI-RSI-DOMINO: H1 broke above 50 (first time in 3 days), still room to expand up, now expect full rotation to the upside
SUSHI-RSI-DOMINO: IF H1 was overbought already, it would be a MUCH harder decision
SUSHI-RSI-DOMINO: m15 50 reset
RSI-DOMINO: Lots of RSI confluence for strength, strength, strength
RSI-DOMINO: Start on HTF (D1) and narrow down to LTF (m15 rsi reset)
RSI-DOMINO: Don't over-think, just buy on m15 with tight SL
RSI-DOMINO-NONE-OVERBOUGHT: Want market to be as flat as possible when doing this
RSI-DOMINO-NONE-OVERBOUGHT: Don't want any time-frame RSI overbought (espcecially HTF)
RSI-DOMINO-NONE-OVERBOUGHT: We want these trades to last over a number of hours (4, 8, 12, 24), don't want them to stall
RSI-DOMINO-NONE-OVERBOUGHT: This is the strength of the RSI domino effect
RSI-DOMINO-SUSHI: H1 cross above 50, H4 and H12 bounce off 50
RESET-OR-IN-MOTION: BTC retesting SR as support with RSI dropping to 57, NOT A RESET, but a market IN MOTION
RESET-OR-IN-MOTION: Full RSI resets to 50 are the best, but when market is strong, may not be granted a FULL rsi reset on high time-frames (eg: drop to 57 RSI is a market "in motion")
RESET-OR-IN-MOTION: Perhaps get full reset on H4 and below, but only "IN MOTION resets" on H12 and above.
RESET-OR-IN-MOTION: RSI "in motion" is also when we say "room to expand up" or "expecting full rotation to the upside now"
RSI-DOMINO-BUT-BEAR-DIV: Don't want to see any bear divs across nearby highs in our RSI domino setup (we would worry that these bear divs haven't fully played out yet)
MARKET-BUY!: No divs, SR retests from above, RSI cool-offs to 50 / breaking above 50 / HTF rsi "in motion" / great domino effect
BULLISH-CONSOLIDATION-UNDER-SUPPORT: Tapping support again and again while still holding the RSI 50 level

CBS Aggressive Conditions Q&A 220728
TRADER-TOM-STYLE: "Play into MOMENTUM UP rather than retests"
PSYCH: Invest in memories with winnings
DIVS: TP into divs; or at least take off 50% to protect great entries / establish a base for our position
DIVS: Can look to add the 50% back in after div over...
DIVS: ...or if it does push on and break the div, still have have 50% position

HTF Trading - Giving Up on Set Ups and Overtrading Yourself Out of Plays
SWING-TRADER: He's a swing trader that looks for LTF entries
SWING-TRADER: eg: HTF bear divs into HTF resistance 
SWING-TRADER: Looking for shorts based on simple HTF analysis
SWING-TRADER: 1) remember what we're trading and why
SWING-TRADER: 2) ignore LTF action unless it directly cntributes to LTF thought process
SWING-TRADER: 3) understand the expectation of where we're trading. LTF versus HTF positioning
SWING-TRADER: Might get a few SLs (lose 1% each time) but need to take these loses to hit the home run
SWING-TRADER: If you want to be a successful HTF (D3 swing) trader, MUST keep attempting LTF (m15) entries despite SLs
SWING-TRADER: LTF entries keeps you focused
SWING-TRADER: Don't discord / CT distract you (they will)
SWING-TRADER: "cbs-HTF-SwingTrader-LTF-entries-1.JPG"

===== MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF THE TREND - SIMPLE TIP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qtd6InKwF4
TREND: Multi time-frame analysis, don't zoom in too much and assume LTF bearish retest when it's actually just done a bullish retest on higher time-frame  
TREND: Make sure you're on the right side of (trending market) HTF trend
TREND: Will make a lot more money if you adopt the thought process to being on the correct side of trending markets
TREND: "cbs-not-a-bearish-retest-CHECK-HTF-1.JPG"
TREND: This is why pumping market keep pumping, no break in HTF structure but people zoom in, try to short, just provide liquity for more pumping

RENKO PART 2 EDUCATION: Renko: Guppy, LTF - HTF, Momentum, Taking Trades, Confluence, Position Building
RENKO2-GUPPY-PARAMETERS: "cbs-parameters-used-for-his-guppy-on-renko1.png"
RENKO2-GUPPY-MAs: Strong trend, MAs wide apart, ready for reversal, MAs close together / tighten
RENKO2-AO: AO works the same with renko as it does with candlesticks
RENKO2-AO: AO very important in showing where the momentum is coming from (>0 bull, <0 bear, divs)
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST: (1) AO bull div (possible trend shift)
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST: (2) flip above guppy MAs too (possible trend shift)
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST: (3) AO crossover above 0 (possible trend shift)
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST: (4) renko bullish market structure break (using clear swing highs and lows) (possible trend shift)
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST-FLUID: This is why he takes partial positions, not all 4 checklist criteria met yet..
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST-FLUID: ..build position slowly then full position size when all 4 criteria met..
RENKO2-ENTRY-CHECKLIST-FLUID: ..4 criteria met means we are following the new trend (domino effect when using renko)
RENKO2-CBS-NORMAL-ENTRY-STYLE: Using LTF renko to enter a MTF/HTF renko trend (nailing entries)
RENKO2-TP: (1) AO crossover below 0
RENKO2-TP: (2) Fall back into the guppy trend
RENKO2-TP: (3) After falling back into guppy, can't escape it (Krill: chop as trend changes)
RENKO2-TREND-FOLLOW: Renko is all about following the trend
RENKO2-TREND-FOLLOW: So exit renko trade when losing the trend
RENKO2-MS: Use CLEAR swing highs and lows to mark MS in renko
RENKO2-SUMMARY: renko good for LTF sclaping utilisiling MAs via guppy to follow trend
RENKO2-SUMMARY: LTF entries on MTF/HTF, renko gives good indication as to when trend is changing
RENKO2-SUMMARY: renko is a trend based trading method, THIS IS WHAT'S IT FOR, get into trend and stay in trend for as long as possible
RENKO2-SUMMARY: renko is for following TREND, also using guppy (MA based) and AO (MA based)

=====Risk Management - What Can I Say?
TITLE: https://youtu.be/uxsJOuoi34Y
BULL: Want to have way more risk on the table in bull markets
BULL: Infinite returns on upside, not so with shorts
BULL: Maths of shorting is worse (bnb at $250, $75 move up is 50%, $75 move down is 33%)
