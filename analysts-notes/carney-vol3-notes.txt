Harmonic Trader Vol 3 Scott Carney

HSI = propritory Harmonic Strength Indicator (like RSI)

BAMM after B point passed, not on C point creation

AB=CD
C retrace of AB=0.382-0.886 range
D projection of BC=1.13-2.618 range
1/.382=2.618
1/.885=1.13
--
0.382 > 2.24, 2.618, 3.14, 3.618
0.50 > 2.0
0.618 > 1.618 (perfect)
0.707 > 1.414
0.786 > 1.272
0.886 > 1.13

BC layering:
AB=CD is a MINIMUM

Gartley B is 0.618 = 61.8%
Tolerance 3% is 0.03
Gartley down tolerance is 0.588 (0.618-0.03)
Gartley up tolerance is 0.648 (0.618+0.03)

*** B-point tolerances (3%)
Gartley B: 0.588 to 0.648

Butterfly B: 0.756-0.816
*** B-point tolerances (5%)
Bat B: 0.332-0.55(-0.618)
Crab B: 0.332-0.668
Deep crab B: 0.836-0.932 (or anything below 1.00)
***
[[Shark: 0.352-0.648]]
[[Cypher B: 0.352-0.648... Carney does NOT use Cypher, use shark instead]]


Deep Gartley approx "batley bartley batley deep gartley"
Bat: SL 1.13XA
---
B Point Ratio= 0.618 (+/-3% Tolerance: 0.588-0.648)
AB=CD Type: AB=CD
BC: 1.618-2.618
XA: 0.786-0.886
Stop Loss > 1.0-1.13X (Depends upon AB=CD)

Crab/deep crab 1.902XA special case extreme price action

Butterfly SL is at lease 1.414. No extension to 1.618!
If B not 786, then it'll be a crab

Shark should give sharp reversal, not linger
TP at the morph into 5-0 (or 0.618 max)
Shark B retracement should be 0.382-0.618 (new limit added)
Shark is distinct, not a W or M pattern

5-0 patterns
0.5 shark retrace & AB=CD square
SL 0.618

Head and shoulders harmonic (p143)
1.618/0.618
1.414/0.707

Terminal bar (Tbar)
”An ideal reversal usually tests all of the numbers in a 
Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) on the initial test. 
The predominant trend usually reverses from this initial test of the entire PRZ and continues in the reversal direction shortly thereafter. In an ideal reversal, the price bar that tests all of the numbers in the PRZ is called the Terminal Price Bar(T-Bar).”
--
"It is very common for harmonic patterns to experience a degree of consolidation as the pattern completes. In these cases, it is common for the price action not to 
immediately test the entire Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) and require some consolidation before reversing. In fact, the price action can linger for some time and then test the final 
number that defines the zone at the pattern completion point."

Harmonics Koz reclaim style: Tbar and PEZ
p158: All parts of PRZ (XA, BC & AB=CD) tested. Tbar is the candle that tests the most extreme part of the PRZ (bullish case = lowest point). Price then close above PRZ to confirm bullish shift. Koz like entry on "reclaim"
--
"Broken" harmonic Permissable Execution Zone (PEZ)
PEZ = PRZ+ TBar
SL below PEZ, wait for PRZ reclaim
If no PRZ reclaim (reversal), just continuation, invalid harmonic
Indicator triggers at or after TBar+1 (RSI or HSI)
May drop to lower timeframe to look for indicator triggers
For example, harmonic on H1 chart, check 15m chart

Reaction (Type 1)
All PRZ tested
IPA = Initial Profit Area (Carney)
Type1 reaction should reach the IPA
The IPA is the 0.382 to 0.618 Fib pull of AD)
IPA = golden retrace zone of Ducc
IPA = initial reation target (SF)
IPA also called IPO (objective, p302)
-- p194
Serial reversal: immediate reversal after PRZ tested
Divergent reversal: not immediate reversal, consolidation at the TBar (range), perhaps even SFP (sweep, Carney calls this a check-back) of TBar or a Ducc "double bottom"
-- p197
Type 1 reaction should occur within 3 to 5 price bars

Reversal (Type 2)
Type 1 has played out (IPA reached) and it will retrace
Price will REVISIT the PEZ (PRZ++) of initial harmonic
Type 2 reversal will have its own TBar
Type 2 (reversals) MUST HAVE price and indicator confirmation
Price confirmation can be patterns / trendlines
Price confirmation might be another harmonic (centipede)
Indicator confirmation can be RSI or HSI
Type 2 will not be as precise as Type 1
Type 2 generally gives more reward (larger reversal)
Type 1 generally gives an initial reaction (to 382 or 618)
Carney says "harmonics often offer two oppertunities, one REACTION and one REVERSAL"

SL Stop loss placement for each pattern is on page 174

Indicators:
Carney tried many - RSI works very well with harmonics
RSI overbought (70) & oversold (30)
RSI 50 level (bullish above 50, bearish below 50)
-- Twice distance half the time (proprietary info)
RSI (bullish trend) 30-to-50, price increase X1 in time Y1
RSI (bullish trend) 50-to-70, price increase X2 in time Y2
X2 > X1 (greater price change)
Y2 < Y1 (in less time)
--
Trendline (uptrend) into overbought.
Simultaneous trendline break-down and reversal from overbought is strong bearish signal (Gainzy trendlines)
- HSI
Carney's priprietary HSI is a filtered version of RSI
HSI ranges between 0 to 100
Overbought > 88.6
Oversold < 11.3

Timeframes
Bars = candles
Harmonics should be at least 30 bars
Find the time-frame that results in the harmonic having approx 30 bars
(discord chat said min 30 bars, max 300)


Summary
Difficulty in harmonics is figuring out which ones have the strongest potential
Where in trend?
