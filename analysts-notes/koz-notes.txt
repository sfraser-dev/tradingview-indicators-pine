=====
BIG-MARKET-DUMP: but coin stays in range = STRONG
BIG-MARKET-DUMP: and coin recovers quickly = STRONG

BUY-ON-STRENGTH: means dips below level and then reclaims it (SR / breaker)

EQUAL-LOWS: If coin paints equal lows, he doesn't love that

CANDLE-INSIDE-WEEK: Look at the weekly chart. Look for "inside weeks".
CANDLE-INSIDE-WEEK: Was an inside week followed by a sweep of the lows and then a pump?
CANDLE-INSIDE-BAR: Doesn't say if market is going to go lower or higher, but market is waiting to decide which direction to go

CANDLE: Candles with no wicks (marubozo / flat bottom) get taken.

INFO: Koz is 23 (2021)

PSYCH: If you have a 5 year time-frame then buying BTC in the 30's (30k) should be very good. He's very bullish on these time-frames.
PSYCH: Most traders fail because of execution
PSYCH: Think 5 years in future, was correct about crypto mooning
PSYCH: don't want to be on the sidelines chopped up / liquidated trying to get rich quick; slow and steady is key

METHOD: Levels he maps out; Koz methodology:
METHOD: Monday's range
METHOD: Weekly ranges
METHOD: Weekly open

Kickin it with Koz: The Importance of Opens (DWMY)

OPENS: "Why is monthly open important"?
OPENS: -The most basic way of looking at it
OPENS: -Go to the monthly chart
OPENS: -Month opens (MO), dips, red candle
OPENS: -Reverses, rises above MO, candle flips green
OPENS: now assume the low (bottom of monthly wick) is the low for the month
OPENS: **So MO is just HTF SR**
OPENS: When MO gets flipped, expect it to continue to trend  
OPENS: When MO gets flipped, expansion away
-
OPENS: Opens can also be used to give bias
OPENS: Above monthly open = bullish
OPENS: Below monthly open = bearish
OPENS: "Opens are HTF SR"
-
OPENS: Check BTC Yearly Open
OPENS: Respected SR level & expands away when flipped
-
OPENS: Can trade spot this way
OPENS: BUY: when above YO
OPENS: SELL: when below YO
-
OPENS: Use 15m chart with DO

TRADE-EXEC-RR: He "lives" in the 1R to 2R trade setup range (sometimes 2.5)
OB-ORIGIN: He called down candle half-way up impulse a demand (which MB would call OB / reaccumulation) but said not good as it's not the ORIGIN of the PUMP (RP also says this)
OB-ORIGIN: Demand is the origin of the move where BUYERS took over from SELLERS
OB-ORIGIN: Supply is the origin of the move where SELLERS took over from BUYERS
