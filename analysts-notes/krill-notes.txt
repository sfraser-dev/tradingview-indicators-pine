"Krillin live stream for the Haven - Scanning and observing MA patterns on 4h and daily chart" 210221
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFVC0Mv89M

STREAM: Use MA system to scan really quickly and flag interesting coin

STREAM: ema13 (trend)
STREAM: [[ema25 (trend) used by pierre, not krillin]]
STREAM: H4-ema200 (macro "fastest")
STREAM: ma100 (macro fast)
STREAM: [[ema200 (macro slower) used by pierre, not krillin]]
STREAM: ma300 (macro slowest)

STREAM: Scan on daily chart, ready when
STREAM 1: ema13 crosses above H4-200ema
STREAM 2: ema13 & H4-200ema point up
STREAM 3: COMPRESSION between H4-200ema & 100ma (100ma points up)

STREAM: MAs should point up to act as support and down to act as resistance. Wait for them to point up

--
BANANA pattern for ** full reset & trend reversal from down (bear) to up (bull)** should be in ascending order (bottom=ma100, middle=ema200, top=ma300)
BANANA pattern order will be opposite if strongly trending up (bullish) (bottom=ma300, middle=ema200, top=ma100) 
BANANA: fast MAs cross from below to above slow MAs=bull-up
BANANA: slow MAs cross from above to below slow MAs=bear-dwn
BANANA: 
BANANA: Target will be the next ma, should be obvious, FILL THE GAP

EXEC: manual SL on daily-timeframes for spot (avoid wicks)
EXEC: Can layer bids to average down price
EXEC: MAs should provide enough support for this
EXEC: COMPRESSION between 100ma & 200ema usually leads to big candles; switch to D3 to check
EXEC: Spot trade on daily chart; don't use binance futures
EXEC: He uses H4 & D1 charts, but can use on any time-frame

SR-LINES: Add in Fib levels for confluence too (on VERY HTF) - don't need other horizontal lines

MA-USAGE: 1. Tell the trend (up / down)
MA-USAGE: 2. S/R levels
MA-USAGE: 3. Compression and expansion
MA-USAGE: "Compression is all the MAs moving together into a tight beam"
MA-USAGE: Compression can occur below PA if PA is also consolidating == hint that explosive move soon
MA-USAGE: Hit rate very high if all the MAs go from descending to ascending

MA-200: He uses ema200 rather than ma200 as it guarentees it's between ma100 and ma300; Krill only uses ema200 (not ma200)

210508 2h20mins mins

GAP: (34 mins) BAT/BTC perfect example of filling MA gaps with compression

COMP: Compression is ranging / ping-ponging between correct order MAs
COMP: banana compression in correct order for moon up:
COMP: ma100 bottom
COMP: ema200 middle
COMP: ma300 top
COMP: Compress / range in this correct order banana for pop up and then huge exansion above and beyond the ma300 (look for untapped highs far away)
COMP: Pre-empting the close / completion of the banana
COMP: fast ma100 crosses the slower ema300; trend reversal

COMP: Beautiful compression within banana (with clean PA) then strong breakout (these are the best)
COMP: Clean PA means reacting well with MAs

COMP: Bullish compression (point up, ma100 cross up)
COMP: Bearish compression (point down, ma100 cross down)

COMP: All MAs super tight = big move soon

BLUECHIP: link & bnb are two of the blue chips that you should be hodling

GENERAL:' MA gets "reset" when it goes from falling to flat
GENERAL: He uses log scale quite a lot
GENERAL: If no (ma300 or ema200), switch on H4-ema200

GENERAL: Every coin is different. Sometimes a particular MA is just not relevant for a particular coin (eg: ma100 not relevant on PPT)

GENERAL: $5k "small bag" for fun scam pump coins (spot with no SL)



=====+++++===== My own MA notes
EXCHANGE: The way we trade on Huobi is similar to Binance but there are a few differences:
EXCHANGE: - MA structure is the same:
EXCHANGE: H4-ema200-> D1-ma100 -> D1-ma200 -> D1-ema200 -> D1-ma300
EXCHANGE: ma200 and ma300 might be at a different location, but the order that never changes is: H4-ema200-> D1-ma100-> D1-ema200

--
SLOWBLEED-DOWNTREND: MA gaps = FVG that will get pumped to and then retrace (against the trend trades)

TREND-REVERSAL: compression of macro MAs and short MAs break above compression, get in on short MA retest (ema13/25)

MA-SWEEP: Pierre pointed out that MAs are like Price Action: Compression of macro MAs, fast MAs dump below these (sweep / SFP) then near vertical after this

TERMINOLOGY: Ping pong chop chop 

The angle of the ma100 at least needs to be flat / pointing up for bullishness

HISTORY: Look back and see how the MAs are being respected (check different time-frames too)

HISTORY: If MA (ma100, ema200 or ma300) is acting as support in uptrend, keep buying support If it is lost, don't "revenge trade", WAIT for COMPRESSION to re-enter

TREND: ema13/ema25 acts as S/R on higher time-frames (D1+)

EARLY-BANANA-BO: If price breaks out early from a forming banana compression, high chance it'll get retested from above

-- Krillin MA Theory Part 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U08mJ_oGyPY
210403

MA-PART1: ema13, H4-ema200, ma100, ema200, ma300
MA-PART1: Bots use MA/EMAs as they are easy to calculate
MA-PART1: MA/EMAs not used much in crypto TA
MA-PART1: MAs define the trend:
MA-PART1: - eg: price is above the MA
MA-PART1: - eg: the MA is pointing up

MA-PART1: An ascending MA will be strong support & weak resistance
MA-PART1: A descending MA will be weak support and strong resistance

MA-PART1: A "dip" is a retracement in an uptrend.

MA-PART1: *** H4-ema200 is the absolute best one (GOAT)***
MA-PART1: *** D1-ma100 is second most important one ***
MA-PART1: D1-ema13 starts pointing up AND being used for support
MA-PART1: But H4-200ema is still sloping down and above therefore will be resistance so price still uncertain
MA-PART1: Want to enter when price above D1-ema13 & H4-ema200 (and both pointing up) 

MA-PART1: When all macro D1 MAs are pointing down means bear market

MA-PART1: HTF MA gaps equals trending market

MA-PART1: Reversal on D1: LTF (ema13 & H4-ema200) pointing up, ma300 starts to flatten, ema200 & ma100 start to rise giving a HTF MA banana compression.

MA-PART1: 1) Angle of MA (steep equals trend strength)
MA-PART1: 2) MA Pointing up or down
MA-PART1: 3) Compression of MAs
MA-PART1: 4) MAs (or compression) above or below price

MA-PART1: Safer trade is to wait for the compression

MA-PART1: Bollinger Bands derived from MAs, centre line is ma20.
MA-PART1: MA/EMA compression is very like what BB does (but much better)

MA-PART1: Compression is a sign of volatility

MA-PART1: Highest hitrate (long):
MA-PART1: Key MAs claimed as support
MA-PART1: All MAs ascending
MA-PART1: Compression is reaching its apex

MA-PART1: V reversals are unlikely (even at a critical Fib)
MA-PART1: Don't knife catch a dump to an MA, Fib (harmonics!)
MA-PART1: Large moves occur after balance between supply and demand found and this occurs after a bit of time (wait for MA compression, don't expect instant V reversal)
MA-PART1: The main purpose of compression is to avoid opportunity cost (don't wait too long for breakout / impulse)

MA-PART1: Opportunity cost. Wait for compression of all MAs.
MA-PART1: If most MAs are compressing but one isn't (eg: ma100 above and pointing down) then don't buy yet

MA-PART1: PA & moving averages
MA-PART1: Coin might be at support / demand
MA-PART1: But there may be resistive MA nearby (above & pointing down) so perhaps just a little bounce from demand

MA-PART1: Keep higher time-frame confluence in mind to maximise win rate
MA-PART1: If using compression on H1 chart, check H4 chart
MA-PART1: If using compression on H4 chart, check H12/D1 chart

MA-PART1: Day-trading: H1-ma100 & H1-ema200 bullish retest

MA-PART1: Scalping
MA-PART1: After compression, we look for expansion of MAs (we know we're in an uptrend now)
MA-PART1: Can scalp on 15m or H1 using ema21, ema34, ema55 catch wicks / retests on these emas (the one which is giving support)
MA-PART1: ema55 is very strong for scalps
MA-PART1: ema34 is very strong for scalps

MA-PART1: What's his ema squeeze pattern? He says he will cover it later.

MA-PART1: H4-ema200 used a lot by krill as support to protect his SL

-- Krillin MA Theory Part 2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCmxDomfzKE
210614

MA-PART2: Fractal nature of MAs (ie: same at different timeframes)

MA-PART2: Continuation compression macro MAs (bullish continuation): top: ma100, centre: ema200, bottom: ma300
MA-PART2: Reversal compression macro MAs (reversal of bearish trend) top: ma300, centre: ema200, bottom: ma100

MA-PART2: ema200 should nearly always be in the middle of macro MAs because of how it's calculated

MA-PART2: MA theory is very like Ichimoku (only much better!)
MA-PART2: krill banana = MA cloud!
MA-PART2: Macro MA compression is a kumo twist!

MA-PART2: Price bottoming & no longer making LLs
MA-PART2: Classic PA (horizontal demand), but opportunity cost. Demand may hold but choppy for a while as macro MAs are decending and gapped.
MA-PART2: May end up buying a bit higher but won't wait so long for break-out

- 200ma 200 moving average
MA-200: If using ma200 as well as ema200 (correct macro order for strong bull trend): top:ma100, ema200, ma200, bottom:ma300
MA-200: (trend very bullish pulls ema200 up more than ma200)
-
MA-200: correct macro order for strong bear trend: top:ma300, ma200, ema200, bottom:ma100
MA-200: (trend very bearish pulls ema200 down more than ma200)
-

MA-200: **TREND REVERSAL** 
MA-200: if bear trend going to banana reverse, ema200 should cross above ma200 as price rises/stalls to CREATE the compression
-
MA-200: if bull trend going to banana reverse, ema200 should cross below ma200 as price dips/stalls to CREATE the compression
--
MA-200: The trend is not fully reset / reversed until the MAs are in back in their correct order

MA-200: See "krill-bullish-bearish-reversal-continuation-matrix1.JPG"

MA-200: ma200 can be a little funky
MA-200: MAs are not lagging as they can be used to make accurate predictions
MA-200: ma200 looks erratic compared to the other 3 macro MAs

MA-PART2: Trend reversal or continuation compression (H4 to D3)?
MA-PART2: Bullish reversals will be bottoming patterns at the end of a long downtrend (flattened MAs)
MA-PART2: Bearish continuation will be at the beginning of a downtrend (steep MAs)
MA-PART2: Clue ema13: acting as resistance (bear) or support (bull)
MA-PART2: Clue H1 zoom: need to reclaim ma100 to perhaps be bullish
MA-PART2: Won't really know if continuation or reversal until MAs uncompress

-
MA-PART2: Compression we want flat and tight macro (cloud) MAs

-
MA-PART2: Pump. Consolidate. Macro MAs gapped. ema200 to be support, if not, to ma300 and ping-pong between ma300 & ma100. Either:
MA-PART2: (1) wait for compression
MA-PART2: (2) ma100 broken, get in on retest

MA-PART2: If buying from H1 chart, always check H4 chart for resistance
MA-PART2: If buying from H4 chart, always check D1 chart for resistance

--
TREND: SHORT MAs (my rainbow 6 emas, "ROYGBIV")
TREND: He doesn't use them on HTF, only on <=H4
TREND: Good for retests in trending market
TREND: Above or below price?
TREND: Pointing up or down?
TREND: In correct order? (if not, more chop)
TREND: Much more bullish if all emas in correct order, ascending and acting as support (break out impulse rather than small range pump)
TREND: Thinking of longing ma100 retest on <=H4?
Look at rainbow emas to see if below price, pointing up, correct order?

SQUEEZE-PATTERN: *** EMA squeeze pattern (42mins into video, see krill-ema-squeeze-pattern1.jpg)
SQUEEZE-PATTERN: Very flat macro MA/EMAs
SQUEEZE-PATTERN: All the short EMAs in correct order curling up
SQUEEZE-PATTERN: Increasing volume

LAZY: *** Lazy mode 
LAZY: MA cheat code (54mins, see krill-lazy-mode-cheat-code.jpg)
LAZY: The lazy mode puts H4 & H1 MA/EMAs onto 1 chart for quick scan
LAZY: Turn off all the candles! (remove price info!)
LAZY: Long the supercross (all crossing flat H4ema200)
LAZY: MA compression is best indicator of volatility
LAZY: USE H4 CHART (My multi-indicator): ema13, ema25, ema34, ema55, ema100, (& H4-ma25==H1-ma100) & H4-ema200
LAZY: Tight cluster of bullish crosses indicates volatility

210217
FIB-RANGE: Fibs, no rule for using wick or bodies
FIB-RANGE: Mostly saying use Fib levels as range
FIB-RANGE: Match the Fib levels to PA S/R
FIB-RANGE: Just like drawing range so great reaction from EQ
On savage dumps want to see bounce at 786

COMPRESSION: MA/EMA compression just needs to be a comparative narrowing of the MAs, not a full-on melding of them.

TARGETS: Can also use Fibs for TP targets

-- Krill DZ Journal Trade Analysis
https://youtu.be/qLHCcIO9bLY
211102
INFO: Account staying the same is not bad (as you're paying fees so actually a slightly winning trader)
GREEN: DZ having a green trade is special, he gets attached to it
RISK-FREE: Moving SL to BE means selling the dip
RISK-FREE: Put a post-it, "don't change SL without TPing"
RISK-FREE: TP1 at RR1 sell 50% trade
INFO: Capital is source of income, always preserve capital
ASSYMETRIC-BETTING: TA gives an asymmetric RR in our favour (lose 1R, win 3R)
ASSYMETRIC-BETTING: We're gamblers playing with probabilities
EXEC: Krill is a day-trader (scalper)
EXEC: Krill will TP before bed (approx 30% to 50%)
EXEC: You should always assume there will be a retest (diagonal, MAs, FVG)
EXEC: I want to buy as close as possible to not being bullish anymore
EXEC: Only look at 15m if you're a scalper
EXEC: If you're careful and lock profit frequently you can get 1% per day; 1.01^365=37.8 (x38 your account in a year)
Always use "reduce only" TPs to prevent shorting after a SL
TP1: About 50% of trades will come back to entry after TP1
TP1: So can treat entry after TP1 as a compunding level
TP1: (if MAs still agree)
TP1: This will get you an additional 0.3R per trade
TP1: Brain thinks in linear way, but successful trader needs to think non-linearly for assymetric gambling
TP1: This could happen often, most don't V-reverse quick, you could be making multiple 1R trades before a V-reverse
ANALYSTS: Fine to copy analysts trades (entries good) ...
ANALYSTS: ... entry & invalidation/SL 2 most important things
ANALYSTS: ... think why their TPs are where they are ...
ANALYSTS: ... SR, MA gap, FVG, FTA/supply, Fib
ANALYSTS: but MAKE YOUR OWN PLAN, don't base on emotions
WEEKEND: Avoid weekend PA, often of reversed on Monday
DAILYPLAN-BTC: Krills daily plan is to give a bias for BTC, not to follow his squiggles exactly - BTC more chance of BULL than BULL, then look for good alt entries. If more bearish, then look to TP a bit more profits on alt trades
DAILYPLAN-BTC: It's Krill's BTC bias for that day and the next few days
LAYERING-BIDS: 1h36m: It's all about probabilities and math
LAYERING-BIDS: **It's the same R if only 1/3 entries hit**
LAYERING-BIDS: 1st bid should be for NO wick, other bids should be for a stinky wick down
LAYERING-BIDS: keep a note of how much lower than intial entry the trade went (0.2R, 0.6R, 0.99R)
LIMITS: Most of your trades should be waiting for limit bids to fill, don't be market buying unless swing/hodl
LIMITS: FTX no fee, BYBIT you get a little money for limits
TRADING 1. look at charts find good RR trades
TRADING 2. game theory: is this where people would buy or take profits?
TRADING 3: Execution plan for TPs (retest level then good for next level, what BTC doing?, don't babysit all the time, no stress.) Greater CONFIDENCE means greater CONVICTION means greater PATIENCE
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: Mostly H1 chart
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: He'll be doing TP1 full then reload at entry again a few times
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: He'll set important SR levels using D1 chart
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: Loma will do the same, use D1 for SR level, mix of D1 & H1, nails his entries, and it looks like magic
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: You cannot use 15m to find setups, use D1 mostly

-- Compression REVERSAL STRUCTURE (reclaiming bearish MAs in order, SQUEEZING and trend acting as support)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3thQ5YZ_Ps&t=4215s
REVERSAL-RECLAIM: Initially bearish
(top=ma300, mid=ema200, bot=ma100)
REVERSAL-RECLAIM: Starts reclaiming each of these macro/cloud MAs (1st ma100, then ema200, then ma300)
REVERSAL-RECLAIM: ALL THE WHILE having ema13 actings as support
REVERSAL-RECLAIM: Compressing (ping-ponging) between ema200 and ma300.
REVERSAL-RECLAIM: MA100 & EMA200 start going flat or pointing up


=====+++++=====
-- Krill general notes / generic notes
EXEC: He is primarily a scalper.
EXEC: Even when in a swing trade, he'll remove some and add it back in as it's ongoing (constant compunding)
GAPS: He scalps mostly H1-compressions to H4-ema200
GAPS: (Can also scalp 15m compressions to H1-ema200)
GAPS: If gaps on H4 macros wide (strong downtrend), can scalp instead from H1-compression to H4-ma100 (nearest macro MA)
SIZE: 7 figure account, usually risks 6k per trade
"krill-7-figure-account-15R-per-month-6k-per-trade.JPG"

-- Bridging (defi farming) nano caps for explosive growth
BRIDGE: 10k to 1M (look for nano caps if you want ot 50x)
BRIDGE: ICX bridging
BRIDGE: NEAR bridging

### Scalping Multi-timeframe (IGNORE)
SCALP: Multi-timeframe scalping (overview, full video soon)
SCALP: D1 chart for bias / volatility
SCALP: H4 chart: compression = impulse
SCALP: H4 chart: no compression = ranging
SCALP: If H4 ranging, can scalp the 15m chart when there is a 15m compression
SCALP: Ideal setup:
SCALP: Long D1 ema13 support while price ranging between SCALP: H4ema100 & #H4ema300. Use H1-ma100 or H1-ema200 reclaim.
SCALP: Check slope of MAs.
SCALP: Can also check short rainbow 6 emas curling up for confluence.

-- New MAs
NEW: New MAs that appear are important.
NEW: Bouncing on new MA is bullish (eg: smma100 (ema200) has just appeared and bounced off of it)

-- MA order importance
ORDER: Macro MAs not in correct order, then less strong signal (shitty compression)
ORDER: In weak market wait for more confirmation on longs**, less confirmation needed for shorts
ORDER: In strong market wait for more confirmation on shorts, less confirmation needed for longs
ORDER: reclaim D1-ema13 (HH), then get in on HL (HL would be confirmation) Higher Low is confirmation of trend shift

-- Levels
RETEST-ENTRY: levels, including our entries, will get retested 20% of the time
RETEST-ENTRY: a better hit rate than any indicator.
RETEST-ENTRY: Should TP partially then reenter on level / entry retest
RETEST-ENTRY: "krill-dont-SL-at-BE-worst-mistake-TP-then-reenter-2.JPG"

-- What time of the day to trade
TIME: If swing trading, use daily chart, 2 hours per day, any time of the day, mark levels and wait / set limits
TIME: If day-trading/scalping, (1) scan at the beginning of your trading session, NYSE open and NYSE close
TIME: NYSE open = 1430
TIME: NYSE close = 2100
TIME: NYSE futures open = 2300

-- Compression above / below price
COMP-ABV-BELOW: Price not in macro banana-compression
COMP-ABV-BELOW: Price following downtrend and banana-compression is above the price (this compression is a volatility bonus)
COMP-ABV-BELOW: "krill-bonus-shorting-trend-with-compression-above.JPG"
COMP-ABV-BELOW: ... "I wanna scale into short for alts doing bearish retests of 4h ema200 or daily EMA13 depending on what trend it's following, bonus if 4h is doing a bearish compression above"
-
COMP-ABV-BELOW: Before he said these compressions above downtrend are liquidity void, try and enter at these compressions
COMP-ABV-BELOW: But in my CRV question, he said the compression had already been bearishly retested (just not at apex) so use compression above as a bonus 
COMP-ABV-BELOW: "krill-compression-above-price1.JPG"
COMP-ABV-BELOW: "krill-compression-above-liquidity-void1.JPG"

-- Casading MA supports (see my Everywhere MTF indicator)
NOT-SUPPORT: "krill-sf-MAs-as-support-levels-5.JPG"
NOT-SUPPORT: From chatting with Krillin:
NOT-SUPPORT: MA100/300 are SRs for daily and 4h only
NOT-SUPPORT: MA100/300 only use for compressions on other time frames
NOT-SUPPORT: On m15 you really want to focus on m15-ema200 for S/R
NOT-SUPPORT: m15-ma100 is more of a bias/probability indicator
NOT-SUPPORT: m15-ma100 flat and curling up is good
NOT-SUPPORT: m15-ma100 still descending is bad
BEST: EMA13/200 are the best
BEST: Also it's about what the coin has reacted the most to
HISTORY: like some coins do react very very well to 1h MA100, some dont
HISTORY: On BTC price doesn't react much to 1h MA100 but 1h MA100's slope is extremely strong (bullish if ascending, bearish if descending)

-- MA system is a price action system (using Pierre as example)
PA: "pierre-sf-MA-system-is-really-a-market-structure-system.JPG"
PA: 1. Horizontal level (old high that becomes support = bullish MS, HH, HL, HH, HL)
PA: 2. H4-trend curling up wait for *2nd tap* = guarentee bullish MS, HH, HL, HH, HL) - get in on a HL
PA: 3. Stoch oversold (momentum on our side too, time to go!)
Horizontal level (1st) and H4-trend (second) are helping to confirm bullish market structure. Stoch is used to help timing and momentum. 

-- SMMA100
NEW: Pay a lot of attention to SMMA100 (quick way to calc ema200) on new listings.
NEW: Look for the highest timeframe it occurs; it'll give a strong reaction
NEW: "krill-smma100-highest-timeframe-new-listings-1.JPG"

-- Trend flip to reversal - Krill method different to Pierre
"krill-when-is-trend-flipped1.JPG"
FRACTAL: Krill method is fractal
FRACTAL: When is H1-trend flipped support, if it has broken and closed above the trend, check the 15m chart (fractal)
FRACTAL: If the 15m chart has flat 15m-ma100 and 15m-ema200 then it's in reversal mode
FRACTAL: If 15m is in reversal mode, the H1 trend should now be flipped (no need for Pierre second retest)
FRACTAL: H1 PA will be choppy until H1-ma100 and H1-ema200 are flat (ready for reversal)
FRACTAL: MAs are fractal (trend flip, macro reversal reclaim, compression)
FRACTAL: 5m is in compression
FRACTAL: 15m is in macro reversal reclaim pattern
FRACTAL: H1 trend flip

-- Scalping tips
SCALPING: For scalping, focus on 1) good entries 2) not taking losses
SCALPING: This is more important that letting winners run. SCALPING: Letting winners run is for trending market
SCALPING: "krill-scalping-methodology.JPG"

-- Weekend scam
SCAM: Shitcoins pumping on BTC weakness during the weekend is a scam
SCAM: "krill-weekend-scam-shitcoins-pump-while-btc-weak.JPG"

--Dino coin BTC pairs
DINO: BTC pairs are worth looking at for dino coins (XMR, XRP)

-- Trading based on NY open
NYOPEN: Question:
NYOPEN: Will you wait for open, watch orderflow and then if NY open pumps, you market buy the good looking coins?
NYOPEN: Answer:
NYOPEN: 1) strongly trending alts on 1h ema13 support are the best
NYOPEN: 2) strongly trending alts on 4h ema13 support second best
NYOPEN: 3) coins that are still giving the 1h compression on 1h ema200 third best

-- Narratives
NARRATIVE: ETH/BTC no longer the definitive pulse of alts
NARRATIVE: Alts now have their own narratives and big liquidity

-- MA/EMA equivaencies on different time-frames
D1-trend: (96 15m-blocks, 24 H1-blocks, 6 H4-blocks)

-- SL distance from entry, conviction and win-rate
"krill-SL-distance-and-conviction1.JPG"
SL-CONVICTION: The more conviction you have for a trade, the wider the stop should be (to prevent getting wicked out)
SL-CONVICTION: The less conviction you have for a trade, the tighter the stop should be
HIGH-CONVICTION: Wicks should be used to layer bids to get a better average entry
HIGH-CONVICTION: High EV from high conviction plays comes from high win-rate
LOW-CONVICTION: low conviction trade (low win-rate) but clean invalidation
LOW-CONVICTION: High EV from low conviction trades comes from high RR

-- Winrate, average R and EV (daily plan 220618)
KRILLS-WINRATE: Consider my usual setup on long day-trades yielding an average 2.2R with a 45% hitrate on average I end up with an EV of 0.44 R per trade on average (=2.2*0.45-0.55*1). 
KRILLS-WINRATE: "krill-winrate-averageR-and-EV.JPG"

ALGO-FPS: Look at EMA13/21 on D1, it is great passive income,
ALGO-FPS: This is virtually the same as FPS yellow/red ball
ALGO-FPS: FPS HAMA is ema21 with Heiken Ashi candles

TA-IMPORTANCE: TA is 25% of trading, the rest is execution and emotional control
TA-IMPORTANCE: "krill-trading-is-25percent-TA-rest-is-execution-emotional-control.JPG"

RISK-MANAGEMENT: Awesome post by Krill (don't move SL)
RISK-MANAGEMENT: - your entry may be visited again without invalidating the thesis behind your trade, so why close the trade?
RISK-MANAGEMENT: - people move SL at breakeven thinking they won't lose money and they're de-risking, but for the same EV/derisking, you can sell 1/3rd of the position at +2R or half the position at +1R and derisk the same. 
RISK-MANAGEMENT: - selling partially even allows you to re-add on entry if hit again to compound
RISK-MANAGEMENT: - in many instances, you see a consolidation on support, you buy the low of that mini consolidation range, but that consolidation range is like 3-5% chop, so you assuming you're online a lot you could even range trade that consolidation, and constantly sell-rebuy and by the time the real pump comes your position could be fully de-risked and yet still be using full-size.
RISK-MANAGEMENT: -selling partially also helps preventing mindfucking yourself during trade execution, if you haven't taken partial profits, you are more likely to panic close on a retracement, hence selling the dip. If you have taken partial profits you are less likely to panic close on a retracement or you may even add if your system says so (like Pierre/my trend base system with EMA13/21 turning continuous support)
RISK-MANAGEMENT: -overall selling partially is just a superior solution. You want to move your SL ONLY if the invalidation of your thesis has changed, in such a case move SL according to the new invalidation
RISK-MANAGEMENT: "krill-dont-move-stop-partial-TPs-AWESOME-POST1.JPG"

90%-OF-SETUPS: 90% of Krill's setups are one of the following 4 setups (deep-retrace, trend, compression or range)
90%-OF-SETUPS: "DEEP-RETRACE": long H4-ema200 or D1-ema200 retests from above on big dumps for coins in uptrends
90%-OF-SETUPS: "THE-TREND" (same as Pierre): ema13 or ema21 continuation on existing uptrend
90%-OF-SETUPS: "COMPRESSION-BOs": H1 or H4 compression breakouts for continuation or reversal after accumulation
90%-OF-SETUPS: "RANGE": sweeps above or below the range when range trading
90%-OF-SETUPS: "krill-90-percent-of-setups-are-one-of-these-four.JPG"

COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: Look to higher time-frame MAs (the macro MAs) to see likely compression volatility direction 
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: EG: Even price below H4-ma100
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: EG: but H4-ma100 curling up
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: EG: if H1-compression, then likely pump to an H4-reversal-reclaim pattern
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: MAs pointing up = weak resistance
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: MAs pointing up = strong support
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: MAs pointing down = strong resistance
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: MAs pointing down = weak support
COMPRESSION-DIRECTION: "krill-compression-volatility-which-direction-to-play.JPG"

BEGINNER: Only use ema200 and ema13 (the trend) if just starting TA with MAs

CONSOLIDATION-TYPES: Good: consolidate under ema200 with trend support want to see strong break with follow-up (?SZ break and hold above plus extra MSB up?)
CONSOLIDATION-TYPES: Bad: weak break with no follow-up
CONSOLIDATION-TYPES: "krill-good-and-bad-consolidations1.JPG"

MA-101: "Reversal reclaim"
MA-101: MA theory 101 when price goes:
MA-101: H4-ema200 -> D1-ma100 -> D1-ema200 -> D1-ma300
MA-101: ...and typically retests the previous MA after hitting one as resistance

KRILL-HIGH-RR-STRATEGY: My strategy is really about catching low entries near invalidation for high R:R and TP all the way up.

MA-CONSOLIDATION-TRIANGLES: MAs are like consolidation triangles, can impulse before apex (compressions)
MA-CONSOLIDATION-TRIANGLES: Also, MAs can be used for SRs and also for volatility (compressions)
MA-CONSOLIDATION-TRIANGLES: "krill-MAs-like-consolidation-triangles-volatility-and-SR-levels-1.JPG"

LADDERED-ENTRIES: "krill-laddering-entries-full-SL-but-partial-profits./JPG"
LADDERED-ENTRIES: Full SL always gets hit but partial position sizes when TPs get hit.
LADDERED-ENTRIES: Krill: But need to factor in the times that all entries filled and all TPs hit, these bangers make up for the partial position wins
LADDERED-ENTRIES: Run 100 simulations to prove this to yourself
LADDER: "krill-how-he-ladders-entries-4of25-or-5of20.JPG"
LADDER: He generally ladders 4 of 25%: 25,25,25
LADDER: or ladders 5 of 20%: 20,20,20,20,20
LADDER: "sometimes" goes a little heavier below:
LADDER: 20,20,30,30 or 15,15,20,25,25
LADDER: when trend trading, he layers between ema13 and ema21

MACRO-MA-PROBABILITIES: flat & tight (bear market rally / squeeze)
MACRO-MA-PROBABILITIES: ma100 slope strongly down when at compression apex helps tell dump coming
MACRO-MA-PROBABILITIES: MAs big gaps and all sloping down is strong down trend
MACRO-MA-PROBABILITIES: MAs flat (ema200 flat) with ma100 curling up good probability of reversal, just need to break out of compression
MACRO-MA-PROBABILITIES: "krill-cool-macro-MA-analysis-probabilities.JPG"

GAME-THEORY: Trading mixes data analysis, game theory,
strategy, and emotional control (& probabilities)
GAME-THEORY: Incomplete information (in trading) forces you to use a probabilistic approach.
GAME-THEORY: I like that since many important decisions in real life are also based on incomplete information.
GAME-THEORY: "krill-Alpha-Illustrated-Interviews-LSDinmycoffee.pdf"
GAME-THEORY: Loma is the GOAT, he often asks himself "what would Loma do?"

TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Educational Post for Riding the Trend
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: "krill-trend-domino-EDUCATION-1.JPG"
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Fractal, eg: price will follow H1-trend between taps of H4-trend
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Occurs when ESCAPING a range / chop, pumping but will mean-revert to trends fractally
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Should start trending in domino / snowball / fractal fashion, from LTF to HTF, trend within trends
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Impulse happens, look for H1-ema13 to hold for a few times (3 or 4)
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: ...then look for it to fail and for H4-ema13 to hold
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: ...bounce off H4-ema13 and then H1-ema13 to act as support again
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: ...after 3 or 4 taps, H4-ema13 will fail, look for bounce from D1-ema13 (if too far away, could bounce at H1-ema200 (approx D1-ema8, marginally before to D1-ema13))
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: GENERAL CASE: m15-ema13 to H1-ema13 to H4-ema13 (to H1-ema200 / D1-ema8) to D1-ema13
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: PARABOLIC CASE: Stong narrative or negative funding, high volume, m15-ema13 to H1-ema13, keep scalping m15-ema13
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: General case much more common than parabolic case
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Execution: Entries spread between ema13 and ema21
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Execution: SL below ema25 (pierre uses wider SL of 32ema)
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Execution: Target between 2R-3R
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Execution: 2R-3R target for trend riding are different from macro MA gap fills (eg: ma100 to ema200) where RR matters less and we just want the gap to fill 
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: can also be used in conjuction with other PA, like UBs range deviation: "krill-UB-range-play-with-EMA-trends1.JPG"

SWING-TRADING: "krill-MAs-for-swing-setups.JPG"
SWING-TRADING: Best MA setups for swing trading
SWING: Flattening of D1-ma100 + D1-ema200, H4-ema200 reclaimed & D1-ema13 turning continuous support
SWING: He doesn't swing much, but expects at least an x2 when he does (doesn't want to wait long for 4R when he can have multiple 4R trades scalping)

TREND-RIDING-EMA13: H4-ema13 is for trend-riding, NOT REVERSALS
TREND-RIDING-EMA13: V-reversals are rare, and so are instant H4-ema13 long support to H4-ema13 short resistance, expect chop first
TREND-RIDING-EMA13: wait for 2nd retest of H4-ema13, or m15 / m30 / H1 compression
TREND-RIDING-EMA13: "krill-H4ema13-is-for-trend-riding-NOT-reversals1.JPG"

TOTAL2: Krill uses TOTAL2 chart to gauge health of alts
TOTAL2: Total2 is the market cap minus BTC

SPOT-RISK: Wanted to risk 5% of account with QNT swing trade but only managed to fill for a 1.5% risk

TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: Krill was asked if layering entries was bad as "price is moving against you" as detailed in Loma's recommended book "Phantom of the Pits" by Trader Tom
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: "krill-btc-scalp-H1trend-entry-PA-trader5-spread-bids-always-Trader-Tom.JPG"
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: "Small wicks down are not price moving against you"
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: Small wicks down are for buying, potentially really nailing entries, 
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: Small wicks down give better RR
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: See also "WICKS-ARE-FOR-BUYING:"
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: "krill-tiny-difference-in-entry-big-diff-in-RR-real-alpha1.JPG"
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WICKS: from "LAYERING-BIDS:" 1st bid should be for NO wick, other bids should be for a stinky wick down
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WHY-LAYER?: The times you do fill all entries and it's a winner will eclipse the "missed gains" of partial entries...
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-WHY-LAYER?: ...see "krill-laddering-entries-full-SL-but-partial-profits2.JPG" - run the simulations!
TRADER-TOM-POSITION-BUILD-ADDING?: MQ idea, can add on MA-trends (Krill style), RSI m15 resets (CBS style)

FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: +EV trades, 3R scalp same as 3R swing
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: mentally, he finds it easier to daytrade, others may fnd it easier to swing
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: real meaning of EV is having a system that results in profit after a series of trades
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: TP and put the money in your pocket
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: keep making assymetrical bets
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: scalp trade 5k risk, won 7R (35k!)
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: 5k risk, 0.3% of portfolio risked, 1.6M portfolio?
FLUID-LEVEL-TO-LEVEL: "krill-be-fluid-psychology-day-trader-level-to-level1.JPG"

SECURE-PROFITS: "When in doubt at resistance, secure profits" SECURE-PROFITS: can always ape back on a retest once resistance is reclaimed if needed, but you cannot sell high again if resistance rejects
SECURE-PROFITS: it seems really obvious when written down like this, but a few people are actually managing their positions based on this because of greed

AO: AO divs are a way of reading flattening (compressing) MAs without showing MAs on your chart
AO: AO divs are a simplified version of MA compressions
AO: AO is an MA difference, usually get AO divs on a slow bleed (price is going down, but as it happens slowly, the gap between the MA reduces and AO goes up)
AO-MACD: Awesome Oscillator and MACD are MA based indicators and are a simplified/aggregated way of looking at the same thing Krill looks at with his MA system
AO-MACD: Krill considers AO and MACD inferior to a full set of MAs if you know MA theory well and can guage possible momentum shifts with MAs
AO-DIFF-PARAMETERS: He's tried different parameters (eg: ema13 and sma25)
AO-DIFF-PARAMETERS: Some are better for automated trade signals 
AO-DIFF-PARAMETERS: but like every indicator / strategy, always a balance between...
AO-DIFF-PARAMETERS: (1) ...catch move early but unconfirmed 
AO-DIFF-PARAMETERS: (2) ...catch move later with more probability of success 
AO-DIFF-PARAMETERS: default AO parameters (sma5 and sma34) provide a decent balance between anticipation and confirmation  
AO-DIVS: Don't mean much to him
AO-DIVS: "says we made a HH, but the new H wasn't high enough to increase gap between short-term MAs
AO-DIVS: are great when you get an extended range, helps to clear the noise during chop, similar to when my MAs start curling up in a range
AO-DIVS: if you just have 2 price "peaks" you're much better off using RSI divs
AO-DIVS: "krill-AO-divs-dont-mean-much-to-him.JPG"


SHITCOINS: After doge and shib pump, look for penny coins to pump next
SHITCOINS: Usual D1-structure (D1-trend, H4-ema200, D1-ma100 reclaim, nice gap to D1-ema200)
SHITCOINS: Also want to see H1-ma100 and H1-ema200 holding on the shitcoins for them to be pump candidates
SHITCOINS: "krill-shitcoin-pump-1-D1-structure-usual-primed-for-pump.JPG"
SHITCOINS: The pattern is: "flat 1h MA100 EMA200 MA300 parallel band with price hovering above 1h MA100 with retests into 1h EMA200 with 4h EMA200 also parallel below the 1h MA band"
SHITCOINS: "krill-shitcoin-pump-11-explanation-pattern-hes-recognised-PATTERN-EXPLANATION.JPG"
SHITCOINS: Uses 40k-70k ("smaller") positions and liquidity is very bad even with this small amount
SHITCOINS: very neg funding coins, observe ones that reclaimed m15-ma100, ideally m15-ma100 curling up, and haven't popped yet.
SHITCOINS: "krill-shitcoin-negative-funding-play-on-m15ma100-curling-up.JPG"

SL-TF-MOMENTUM: SL placement depends on momentum & timeframe
SL-TF-MOMENTUM: The higher the TF, the wider the SL
SL-TF-MOMENTUM: When trading against the trend, the stronger the trend, the wider the SL
SL-TF-MOMENTUM: trading against the trend is either full reversal or mean revision

CAPITAL: 2018 crash had $150k of his own and $80k of friends and family
CAPITAL: now portfolio between 7 and 10 figs
CAPITAL: 1% risk for him is now more than his old monthly salary, not mentally comfortable risking more than this (says his "risk-averse" and cannot do the sizes loma does)

LIQUIDITY: Need to think where liquidity is located, not just the MAs
LIQUIDITY: "krill-liquidity-theory1.JPG"

DISCRETIONARY: He doesn't have the skills to be a quant, but he's a very good discretionary trader

TRADING-COMPONENTS: "TA is 20% of trading then it's 40% strategy (crafting good setups), 30% emotion control/discipline, 10% luck"

SCALPING-ETHOS: "scalping is no emotion no greed otherwise NGMI - lower timeframe = more opportunities for trades, and also higher probability of quickly roundtripping your entry"

DALAI-LAMA: "Volume is key for possible dalai-lama" (along with trend reclaim)
DALAI-LAMA: "krill-dalai-lama-volume-is-key1.JPG"

TREND-RECLAIM: The trend is reclaimed when we break above & ideally next candle close above too
TREND-RECLAIM: Trend rarely goes from bearish to bullish, always a period of chop (chop through the trend)
TREND-RECLAIM: "krill-when-is-the-trend-reclaimed-continuation-or-reversal-1.JPG"
TREND-RECLAIM: Continuation or reversal?
TREND-RECLAIM: Reversal: not clear with trend, check for compressions on a lower TF
TREND-RECLAIM: Reversal: also need to use PA / liquidity
TREND-RECLAIM: Continuation: just bid the trend (this is nearly what Pierre does exclusively)

CORRECT-TREND: m15-ema13 bearish trend is ONLY of interest if we're already trending below H1-ema13
CORRECT-TREND: H1-ema13 is ONLY of interest if we're trending below H4-ema13
CORRECT-TREND: "krill-when-is-the-trend-valid-2.JPG"

BEST-MAs: "I know at first having a lot of moving averages on your chart can be a bit overwhelming"
BEST-MAs: "ema13/21 for the trend is important, especially if you're reading Pierre's analysis and trade ideas on top of mine"
BEST-MAs: "ema200 is the best and depending on the time frame there is this key info that m15-ema200 is pretty much the same as H4-EMA13, so that means we can translate low TF compressions on the m15 chart into H4 trend reclaims and rejections"
BEST-MAs: "H4-ema200 is great to display on every single time frame, and ma100 is also good on every single timeframe."
BEST-MAs: "ma20/ema54/ema89 from my indicator can be ignored."
BEST-MAs: "And a bit controversial take because it's a very popular one for stocks and even crypto, but I think ma200 isn't great at all and I always ignore it and prefer to work with ma300 which makes the compressions with ma100 and ema200 in my system."

STRONG-IMPULSE: After strong impulse from the lows, look to enter safely on H1-trend
STRONG-IMPULSE: After strong impulse from the lows, look to enter aggressively on m15-trend for parabolic moves

NEWS: Krill doesn't really read the news, info is baked into the chart

WICKED-OUT: Would rather have a tight stop with high R than a loose stop with low R.
WICKED-OUT: Will get wicked out more, but much better EV.

JOURNAL: Add 2 more columns, MAE & MFE, what happened to coin after closing the trade?

APEING-POINTLESS: many market buys will leave the books empty on the buy side
APEING-POINTLESS: MM's job is to try to ensure optimal liquidity at all times
APEING-POINTLESS: MM will tend to sell and bring back price to where it was trading before the aping
APEING-POINTLESS: even more true for altcoins with less liquidity than BTC or ETH
APEING-POINTLESS: (MQ: creates an inefficiency / single-prints)

DEADCAT-BOUNCE-MA100: when a strong uptrend and ema13 support lost, ma100 likely only a deadcat bounce..
DEADCAT-BOUNCE-MA100: ..as ema13 is now resistance, ema200 is stronger support
DEADCAT-BOUNCE-MA100: "krill-typical-ma100-deadcat-bounce-1.png"
DEADCAT-BOUNCE-MA100: "krill-ma100-deadcat-bounce-area1.png"

COMPRESSION-m15: Blacksphere: Check H1 & H4 for confluence. If shorting m15-compression, check for H1/H4 MA resistance too
COMPRESSION-m15: "aggr-krill-system-compression-example-3.png"

FRACTAL: A LTF (H1) compression to possible HTF (H4) trend riding
FRACTAL: "krill-MQ-fractal-example-H1banana-and-H4trend-1-H1.png"

TRAD-FI: forex on m15 and H1

TRAD-FI: stocks on D1 and D3 charts
TRAD-FI: "krill-forex-channel-start-and-focuses.png"

TRAD-FI-NOT-24HOURS: crypto is open 24 hours so MAs align across timeframes
TRAD-FI-NOT-24HOURS: but tradfi isn't 24 hours so this alignment is lost
TRAD-FI-NOT-24HOURS: system still works, but can't assume H4ema200 == D1-ema32 anymore (as Pierre does)
TRAD-FI-NOT-24HOURS: "krill-MAs-for-stocks-do-not-align-across-timeframes-like-crypto-coz-not-open-24hours.png"

MAs-AND-RANGES: Awesome educational write-up about how MAs and ranges are used together to help decide reversal or continuation bias
MAs-AND-RANGES: There are 3 types of setup (1) Reversals (2) Continuations (3) Ranges 
MAs-AND-RANGES-REVERSALS-1: HTF SR and MA-banana (great for slower FULL reversal)
MAs-AND-RANGES-REVERSALS-2: HTF SR + divergence (good for (rare) V-reversals, but dead-cat bounce longs in bear market)
MAs-AND-RANGES-CONTINUATION-1: immediate continuation off ema13/ema21 
MAs-AND-RANGES-CONTINUATION-2: re-accumulation continution via compression
MAs-AND-RANGES-CONTINUATION-3: MAs are fractal, m15-compression will OVERLAP H4-trend (m15-ema200 == H4-ema13)
MAs-AND-RANGES-CONTINUATION-4: MAs are fractal, H1-compression  will OVERLAP D1-trend (almost, H1-ema200 == D1-ema8)
MAs-AND-RANGES-RANGING: ** range identification can be useful in MA-reversals and MA-continuations **
MAs-AND-RANGES-RANGING: longs at RL and shorts at RH are actually lower timeframe MA-reversals
MAs-AND-RANGES-REVERSION: reversion could also be called a fourth play (after reversals, continuations and ranges) 
MAs-AND-RANGES-REVERSION: but this is covered by ranges for horizontal reversion
MAs-AND-RANGES-REVERSION: and by ema13/21 continuation for MA reversion
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAN: must know if you're playing a continuation, a reversal or a range
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAN: in a range for a long time, need to plan if it's a break out or a deviation
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAN: in a trending environment, must plan for (1) parabolic blow-off top, (2) continutaion or (3) reversal
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAN: obviously, don't apply range strategies when it's trending and don't apply trend strategies when it's ranging..
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAN: .. for example, don't ape into H1-trend retest within a H1-compression, it'll likely dump hard to H1-ma100 and ignore H1-trend
MAs-AND-RANGES-INTERTWINED: a "LTF" trending market will be in a very "HTF" range, zoom out to see the range, RH likely top of trending market
MAs-AND-RANGES-INTERTWINED: a "LTF" range will likely result in chopped up "LTF" MAs, don't use these chopped "LTF" MAs to trade, sit on your hands
MAs-AND-RANGES-SZ-STYLE: after big move (impulse), don't assume V-reversal (rare, we don't trade), assume consolidation / range will occur
MAs-AND-RANGES-SZ-STYLE: if consolidation looks good, and want to long, buy support (or deviation below) for good RR trade
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAY-RANGE-MULTIPLE-TIMES: In range/consolidation and sure of reversal but not when (NOT using MAs here!)
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAY-RANGE-MULTIPLE-TIMES: can buy RL/deviation (embrace wicks) and sell RH (35%) multiple times, earn perhaps 0.5R+ while waiting
MAs-AND-RANGES-PLAY-RANGE-MULTIPLE-TIMES: allows you to build up a larger position without increasing risk (since sure of reversal)
MAs-AND-RANGES-COMBOS: mini ranges / consolidations (range trading) will occur in a strongly trending market..
MAs-AND-RANGES-COMBOS: ..and if we zoom out, the strongly trending market will be occurring in a much bigger range
MAs-AND-RANGES-COMBOS: ..ranges within trends and trends with ranges (fractal)
MAs-AND-RANGES: "krill-education-MAcontinuation-MAreversal-and-Ranges-AWESOME-01.png"

EV: In HTF high conviction trades (swings), use wider stops (so not wicked out) - EV on these trades comes from win-rate, not RR
EV: Note: a little different to CBS; CBS will accepts the SLs and enter multiple times aiming for high RR on MTF/HTF swing trades 
EV: "krill-high-conviction-trade-EV-comes-from-winrate-not-RR-1.png"

H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: "krill-education-H1trend-continuation-setup1.png"
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 1. Type of setup: Continuation (H1-EMA13 reclaim on reversal is a different setup)
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 2. Context: As we're looking for continuation of the momentum we ideally wanna play this when:
   a. We have a strong trend, ie: price already trading above 4h trend, even better if broke out of a 4h or 1h reversal or continuation compression
   b. We just had a reversal with a very strong impulse from the lows (extremely good on BTC, especially like BTC SFP's/swept/spring from the lows of a range)
   c. Actually a sub-case of a. except we just had a very strong trend or parabolic move following the 15m trend. Once 15m trend is lost, you're looking to bet
      that 1h EMA13 will still hold. (of course if giga blow-off into HTF resistance don't do that, you're better off looking for a short...).
      Note: do not play 15m trend reclaim, high probability of price just chopping around it. Once 15m trend is lost, the parabolic move is over
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 3. Entry: bid between EMA13 and EMA21 - if the context is very bullish, usually EMA13 won't break, but still wicks between 13 and 21 are for buying. 
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 4. Filters for confluence:  
   - fully reset 1h stoch RSI
   - horizontal S/R level around the same level as 1h EMA13/21
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 5. Signs to avoid the setup: (opposite of confluence) 
   - make sure you have marked your HTF levels and you're not in HTF resistance. Daily tf exhaustion, daily bearish divs.
   - if the coin already gave 3-4 1h continuations, well either it should/should have gone parabolic, or the 1h trend is getting exhausted.
   Works best on 1st and 2nd consolidation above 1h trend.
   - in these cases you likely wanna wait for 4h or daily trend
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 6. Stop: below EMA21 ideally between 25 and 30 or just a bit below 21 will do - I would say try to figure out the optimal R:R, especially if we're in case c.
   after a parabolic move EMA30 may be too far and ruin the R:R. If in a. and long consolidation above EMA13 then slightly below 21 is just fine.
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: 7. Targets: you usual liquidity levels, order blocks, HTF horizontals, HTF MAs - nothing special on this setup. But since we're looking for a
   continuation leg, big and quick candles should be TP'ed partially even if not hitting the planned partial targets.

COMPRESSION-BETWEEN-MAs: consolidating BELOW D1-ema200 and D1-ema13
COMPRESSION-BETWEEN-MAs: GOOD: D1-ema200 flattening/curl-up with D1-ema13 very ascending
COMPRESSION-BETWEEN-MAs: BAD: D1-ema200 weaker with D1-ema13 flat
COMPRESSION-BETWEEN-MAs: "krill-education-hard-consolidation-between-MAs-1.png"

BULL-MARKET-H4ema200-H4ma100: In strong bull market, H4-ema200 should hold and H4-ma100 resistance should break on the 2nd tap

MICRO bias (eth & alts) is D1-ma100
DFK: Half in jewel farm (garden) and half in the bank 45mins
DFK: Help guard against inpermanent loss
GAP: MAs far apart = "messed up" = accumulation
GAP: it'll remain accumulation until macro MA compression
GAP: On D1 chart, add H4-ma200
GAP: Very first sign of new trend is claim of H4-ma200
GAP: then tightening and claiming of H4-ema200 & D1-ema13
GAP: safest entry is OUT of compression area and get..
GAP: ..in on retest of H4-ema200
GAP: Don't get trapped in crab market
FUTS: Keeps 40k in binance futures
FUTS: ..was using 5x leverage on..

FUTS: Risks 0.2% to 0.3% of account per DAYTRADE..
FUTS: ..satisfied with the money he generates..
FUTS: ..doesn't want to start trading with..
FUTS: ..million dollar position size - too stressful
FUTS: ..makes between 3k-20k per trade when going well
FUTS: He keeps lots of stable coins on his ledger
FUTS: He uses leverage to keep less money on exchange
FUTS: So just 40k in binance futures is all he needs 
MM: He only trades spot with exotic shitcoins in his metamask
EXE: He used to be good at TA but bad at trade execution
EXE: Now, will close 30%-50% before bed
EXE: If over-sizing trades, tend to exit at BE too much...
EXE: ..because PA is always choppy
EXE: should TP when happy / well in the green..
EXE: ..close 30%-50% of position..
EXE: ..do this consistently and you'll do well
EXE: proper (stress free) sizing will help with..
EXE: trade execution
EXE: He's jealous of Loma's huge position sizes..
EXE: ..Krill just can't do it, too stressful
SCAN: triple MAs at SR level on D1.. set stink bids there..
SCAN: ..to catch nuke
REV: Reversal structure, first, reclaim ma100, then ema200, then ma300 and have ema13 as support each time
REV: Consolidate between MAs to allow ema13 to catch up
REV: This is what MA Theory is all about
DIAG: Parallel diagonals can give nice TP targets (ctrl-drag original support diagonal
SL: Have to put the stop below ema13 and H4-ema200
SL: Enter by estimating ema13 trajectory
CLEAN: Use the "cleanest" MA (the one that seems to be respected most
FIBS: pull Fib swing low to high (0, 236, 382, 500, 618, 786, 1) there should be a way of making the levels fit the PA very well (like Koz match range EQ)
FIBS: just roughly fit the Fibs to the price levels
SWINGS: Look to enter spot swings on ma300
DAYTRADE: Look at HTFs first, then H1 for entries
DAYTRADE: Krill is daytrader mostly on H1 chart
STOCH: He added Stoch RSI after Pierre's success with it
STOCH: Careful with Stoch without other confluence, it can remail oversold a very long time
STOCH: He uses Stoch as Pierre uses it
STOCH: Great for H4-trend retests with Stoch confluence
STOCH: Stoch floored and H4-trend support is a long
STOCH: Stoch maxxed and H4-trend resistance is a short
STOCH: "krill-indicators-used-rsi-mfi-stochRSI-1.JPG"
CLEANCHART: He keeps only ema200 when scanning (removes ma100, ma300 and ema13)
H12: H12 timeframe is tricky, works on some coins but not on others (works on ETH)
CHOPPY-PA: If have a strong compression but price is choppy around it, then ignore compression, it is gone (would like to see a quick reaction)
CHOPPY-PA: If price is choppy, MAs can tell you if it's actually still trending up (correct order, point up)
TIME-FRAMES: Higher time-frame always prevails (D1, very occasionally D3)
TIME-FRAMES: Then look at H4 (and H1 when scalping)

DUMB: Looking for coins that have pumped a little bit (vol increasing) then ape in for the bigger pump
DUMB: Look for coins not on perps (can't be shorted), just spot
DUMB: Thinks it's algos fomo'ing that cause these pumps
DUMB: Scan D1 charts, retest of H4-200ema
DUMB: But spot with no SL, set TPs between 40% and 200% up
DUMB: No SL as can dump hard first, small bags, scam wicks up

MA-THEORY: When ma100 & ma300 are far apart expect chop
MA-THEORY: Chops until compression takes place
MA-THEORY: Compression is tight and trend is support, this is where to enter swing longs
NO-FUTS: Krill and Pierre
NO-FUTS: Flipping shitcoins in 2019 for 10-20%, Pierre
NO-FUTS: Buying H4-ema200.

BANANA: Reversal from downtrend, want to see ma100 starting to turn up with ema200 & ma300 tightening / flattening
COMPRESSION: D1 macros together and flat is good 
COMPRESSION: trend (& H4-200ema) support and curling up
COMPRESSION: macros & trend gap getting smaller and smaller
COMPRESSION: HH & HL too
COMPRESSION: When everything is compressed, there will be no MA resistance above
COMPRESSION: Compression above price is NOT good (compression below price is good)
COMPRESSION: Usually H1 compression will pop when H4-100ma catches up

15m ema200 == H4 13ema (200/4/4 = 12.5)
EXTEND: Extend MAs with brush to guesstimate SLs
EXTEND: Especially MAs that have interacted well with price
TREND: **ema13/21 must be clean continuous support before using it to buy daytrade ** especially with Stoch oversold
TREND: Don't trust trends/MAs that are being chopped by price
TREND: Want to use macro MAs for compression (excellent volatility indicators) and ema21 for entry / catch continuation
TREND-PLAYS: Trend is being chopped by price (eg: H4), when trend then acts as support the macro MAs will start expanding only on lower time-frames (eg: H1), can now enter trend on H4-ema21 and ride the trend (remember 15m-ema200 = H4-ema13 trend)
TREND-PLAYS: After this happens can enter on the next trend test
TREND-PLAYS: When you see this, higher probability for trend to continue rather than reverse
TREND-PLAY: Continue milking until higher time-frame resistance
REENTER: D1 trend or H4-ema200
GRADIENT: ma100 steep down = more chance resistance
H4: H4 time-frame is "short term swinging"
H4: 15m (scalp/daytrade), H12/D1 swinging. D3/W1 position
H4: H4-ema200 is the golden entry
SL: SL should be just below where you stop being bullish
ALERTS: set alerts so not affected by red candles that brought price back down to your zone; stick to your plan
ALERTS: !!Only take trades from alerts!!
ALERTS: Don't take trades based on emotions
TREND: If trend is accelerating, check lower time-frame to see if ema13 & ema21 are being very respected
H1: krill normally trades H1 middle time-frame, not good for scalps, not good for swings, "bastard timeframe"
H1: bastard time-frame, should only be used for fully compressed macro MAs
H1: hard to trade with krill's MA system
ma100 won't hold as support, to ema200, then ma100 acts as resistance.
H1: must always check D1 for resistance and levels
NOISE: when MAs on a time-frame are flat and getting chopped by price (never respected) ignore the MAs, they are just noise
NOISE: some time-frames might be noise (eg: H4 chop) but H1 might be clean
MA-users: MM, quants and bots are generally using MAs

ICT: ICT style is demand/supply/OB/breakers via MSBs
ICT: ICT and MA theory go very well together
ICT: Still using MSB, HH, HL
ICT: Flat MAs mean undeterminded MS, choppy not good, don't trade with MAs, range trading environment
ICT: So MAs and ICT go very, very well together, don't need to throw out ICT style levels if using MA theory
ICT: If MAs flat / ranging, zoom out
ICT: Goto HTF (D1, D3, etc) and mark SR levels as these ARE demand and supply level
ICT: ICT style is the best for forex, but CBS-style SR levels / pivots better for crypto as much more wicks / volatility
ICT: Don't just use MAs, must use MS / SRs too
ICT: Krill "Market structure is always King"
ICT: Going to have ridiculously good confluence between SRs and Krills MAs
ICT: Krill is a PA / MS trader who uses MAs to give well timed entries (opportunity cost, choppy price for a week while holding via leverage, likely to sell a mini-dump as opposed to mini-pump in the chop)
-
TREND: 10 mins ADA, 52 mins LOOKS
TREND: Trend, once claimed and successfully retested once, probabilty is that it'll hold on subsequent retests
TREND: Trend and macro MAs are DIFFERENT
TREND: Trend shows where we can compound / reenter positions withing a forming banana
TREND: Krill typically spreads bids between ema13 and ema21 when riding the trend
TREND: When riding the trend, make sure ema200 not too close as it might struggle to break it easily and chop for a while
-
PLAN: Need to plan and anticipate / assume, need to get in & anticipate / assume moves or we will miss them.
PLAN: We will often see signs of banana compressions beginning to form on a higher timeframe
-
FRACTAL: MA theory is fractal in nature, H1-banana to a forming H4-banana (anticipate), this H4-banana will be in a forming D1-banana
FRACTAL: LTF Compressions are nested within HTF timeframe compressions
-
PLAYOUT: H1-banana (enter) to H4-ema200 resistance (sell); Krills normal scalping method
PLAYOUT: Now in forming H4-banana (we're anticipating this)
PLAYOUT: If H4-100ma is far away and trend is close, reenter on H4-trend, SR & HL after H4-200ema rejection (aim for H4-300ma)**
PLAYOUT: If H4-100ma is close and trend is close, look to enter more safely here (H4-100ma, H4-trend, SR & HL)
PLAYOUT: Break out of H4-banana aim for forming D1-banana (likely aiming to sell on steep D1-100ma resistance)
** HH, HL, HH, HL bullish market structure, look for HL entries with SR & MA confluence (we're PA traders)
-
COMPRESSIONS: Macro compression suggests both bias and timing
COMPRESSIONS: timing helps with oppertunity cost, paper-handing position and avoiding chop
COMPRESSIONS: Compressions are not just when macros are "tight", it must be a banana shape
COMPRESSIONS: Ideally want to enter the banana compression at its apex
COMPRESSIONS: Compressions at apex at superior to diagonals
COMPRESSIONS: Krill mostly daytrades H1 charts on leverage so does not want to see chop
COMPRESSIONS: H1-banana near apex should give pump soon (opportunity cost)
-
ANGLES: Very descending MA means high chance at being resistance
ANGLES: Flat MA means high chance at being broken and turned to support (flipped)
ANGLES: Ascending macro MA beneath (eg: H4-100ma) means bullishness confluence
-
SL: Krill sets tight SLs not using ATR, but looking at recent bigger wicks down. Recent bigger downwicks will give an indication of book thickness so use these to judge where to set tight SL.
SL: Will definitely expect banana compression to hold, so very tight SL using recent downwicks as tolerance
SL: Trend, should hold on 2nd and subsequent taps, use recent downwicks for SL tolerance setting
SL: The stronger the trend (later tests), the tighter the SL
SL: At trend start (less tested) use wider SL
-
RR: Krill has tight stops, high RR, will get stopped out quite a bot. But when everything starts very trending, he'll have high winrate and ridiculous RR ratios
-
BO: Krill doesn't usually play breakouts (perhaps if **volume high**)
-
PUMP-HL: Saw huge pump on ICX (biggest gainer of the day) so asks where is the next likely HL (D1/H4 for SR, look at H1 chart with compresssion at the SR for his entry / trigger)
-
INFO: Krill started using MAs early 2019, 3 years now.
INFO: Started using compression 6 months before The Haven created

LOMA: if nuke doesn't come he'll be OK since scaling in and out a lot
LOMA: If he posts daily chart basically need to scale in all the way between his entry and his stop
LOMA: This is how he can counter-trend trade successfully, large scaling in and derisking quickly, adding again to compound
LOMA: Great for learning to improve execution
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: H1 compressions for day trading
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Two things that work together ma100/ma300 (Krill's ichi cloud) and ema200
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: ema200 nearly always in the middle of ma100/ma300 because of maths
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Algos quants use ema200, very reliable
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Can ANTICIPATE the H1 "ichi" compression coming based on ma slopes
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Look for compressions with diagonal BOs as many people will ape the diagonal BO (diagonals don't work by themselves)
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Banana compression; tell when volatility coming
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Banana compression: H1 compression breakout and then retest
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Uses H1 because bananas on 15m don't play out often and H1 resistance too close
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Ignore 15m compressions
KRILL-SYSTEM-1: Order of MAs important
KrillSystem1: ma300 support means continuation compression

JOURNEY: Humiliation / embarassing
JOURNEY: Now strong (dead inside to humiliation)
JOURNEY: Thinks in probabilities
JOURNEY: Trading is a job like any other
JOURNEY: Like any other job, it is not for everyone
JOURNEY: 1. Risk management rules
JOURNEY: 2. Study
JOURNEY: 3. You can be profitable (not Loma style, but OK, he's been trying for 4 years to be as good as Loma but cannot)
JOURNEY: 4. Need passion (find strategies you like, scalping, investers, MM strategies (always hedged))
JOURNEY: He had full time job (45h/week) PLUS 40h crypto at night and weekend PLUS ebarrasing after losing friends/family money
JOURNEY: find strategies you like, scalping, investers, MM strategies (always hedged), writing algos
JOURNEY: very humbling experience, ego, need to learn to be a professional loser, character building
JOURNEY: Poker, EV, probabilities
JOURNEY: Trading teaches a lot about yourself (Krill found out he's very impatient so being a scalper suits him)
PSYCH: You're against your own mind when trading
PSYCH: He's very impatient, good at m15, H1, H4 (and D1), but not vHTF (swings) as his short term bias takes over
PSYCH: A vHTF swing might be for 5R (weeks / months) but he can get a 5R trade using his scalping method, hence his impatience
PSYCH: He thinks he might use options as this will help with his vHTF bias changing (set and forget)
PSYCH: He is very patient with entries (as he's learned it costs a lot to not be patient with entries)
PSYCH: Used to be impulsive before trading, but now "dead inside", you cannot trigger him or hurt him after his JOURNEY of embaressing himeself with family and friends 
RISK: He'll risk about 0.3% for his day trades and about 3-4% for his swings
CHARTING: Trading is not just about charting, can be great at TA but bad at execution (maybe coding algos removes you from the difficult trading psycops)
SKILL: Trading is a skill you'll always have, and you can trade anything (crypto, commodities, stonks)
TREND-SYSTEM: It's really just a moving mean reversion system
TREND-SYSTEM: H4-ema200 and D1-ema13 are his two best MAs
TREND-SYSTEM: Very safe system
TREND-SYSTEM: Pointing down is bearish, pointing up is bullish
TREND-SYSTEM: Need patience to only use H4-ema200 and D1-ema13
UB: He posts all his trades, the only other trades he takes are those from other analysts
SPECIALIST: Trend specialist
SPECIALIST: Doesn't believe in V-reversals
SPECIALIST: Doesn't really buy spot or DCA, really just a LTF trader (DCAing in downtrend is bad)
PICO: Don't need to catch pico tops or bottoms
PICO: Thinks of trades in terms of EV, risk reward AND probability of success...
PICO: ... can buy higher with much more confidence with cleaner invalidation so setup has much bigger EV even though buying higher (CBS says this too, TraderSZ says this too, etc, RP breakers biggest winrate, confirmation higher)
PICO: A 3R or 5R setup is the same RR no matter what price you're buying at
PICO: Knows folk that scale down into divs then scaling out on bounces (needs disciple and much more advanced)
FOMO: Buy gig green candle
FOMO: Bag-holding and just refusing to sell at any loss (no plan)
ACCOUNTS: Should benchmark your accounts in fiat, need fiat to pay bills
ACCOUNTS: Your capital is the source of your income

DINOS: Will look at xxx/BTC for dino coins only (eg: xmr/btc, trx/btc)
CHARTALERTS: 51m38 logs into chartalerts.io
TRADING: We don't control the market, we only control our risk and our entries
TRADING: We're here to make money, and making money starts by not losing money
TRADING: Krill is a "trend and momentum trader" (also a PA trader)
STATS: Trading is all about probabilities
STATS: Riding m15-ema13 well, but statistically, 70/80% of wicking into H1-ema13 (knows as been trading MA system for years)
RANGE: In choppy PA, Krill switches to Fib-SRs
RANGE: Fib targets: 1.618, 2.00, 2.414
CASHOUT: He's cashed out of binance (his main trading platform) just got "small" 5 fig account that he'll leverage up to low 6 figs for scalping
LAYERED-BIDS: If they fill, you can de-risk on a small bounce as the low buys should give good RR.
SWING-TRADING: Why swing? Can get similar setup with same R day-trading.
SWING-TRADING: If he has swing (mid-term) long position open, it affects him mentally taking scalp shorts
SWING-TRADING: XMR and QNT would be his choices for swing trading.
SWING-TRADING: XMR for privacy, QNT as working with the EU and swift (CBDC)
SWING-TRADING: BITREX: QNTBTC*BTCUSDT to see full history of QNT

===== Full Scan 220811 (just scanning, not educating)
MEME-PATTERNS: Expect fakeouts in both directions
PICO-TOPS-BOTTOMS: TOTAL and TOTAL2 are way more accurate for predicting macro tops and bottoms
GAP-FILL: period of chop / consolidation, break D1-ma100, gap-fill to D1-ema200
GAP-FILL: best when D1-ma100 is flat/ascending too
GAP-FILL: if still descending, check H12, close to banana?
GAP-FILL: can compare relative strength of coins against each other based on their MA gradients
GAP-FILL: D1-ema13 (D1-trend) should be respected as
the gap fill is about to happen (reversal reclaim pattern)
MARKET-OVERVIEW-6-CHARTS: DXY, SPX, BTC, ETH, GOLD, ETHBTC
MFI-INDICATOR: H1 spikes up good sell signal
MFI-INDICATOR: H1 spikes down good sell signal
HEDGING: His hedges are more like swing trades, not his normal day trades
HEDGING: "krill-hedge-setup-example-more-like-swing-than-daytrade.JPG"
D1-TREND-MA100-COMPRESSION: Pierre doesn't need D1-ma100 to be reclaimed and curling up to preempt the pump (krill does)
D1-TREND-MA100-COMPRESSION: "pierre-reclaim-D1trends-to-D1ma100-to-D1ema200-4-krill-disagrees.JPG"
LUCKY-ENTRIES: Layer bids between entry and SL to catch big wicks for "lucky" entries with huge RR
PINESCRIPT: Wants to write TV code so he can auto detect compressions
PINESCRIPT: Seeing some possible reversal reclaims on D1 charts, so have code to tell him which H12 charts are compressing would be great
PINESCRIPT: Would be very useful but always too much to do
D1-EMA13: If support is CLEAN, will give good krill setups
MARKET-STRUCTURE: Must consider MS when scanning
MARKET-STRUCTURE: bid HLs, asks LH
MARKET-STRUCTURE: also mentioned general MS like Lomas "triple drive dying momentum" need to know these patterns
MARKET-STRUCTURE: "krill-bullish-and-bearish-rising-structure-LOMA-triple-drive-dying-momentum1.JPG"
MARKET-STRUCTURE-MOMENTUM-101: Parabolic moves (MA separate & increasing volume) with rounded tops (MAs compress with reducing volume)
MARKET-STRUCTURE-MOMENTUM-101: "krill-momentum-parabolic-rounded-top-like-loma-triple-dying3.JPG"
MARKET-STRUCTURE-MOMENTUM-101: MS is king but there are different kinds of bullish MS
MARKET-STRUCTURE-MOMENTUM-101: strong bullish MS, distance between HHs and HLs increasing, stong momentum
MARKET-STRUCTURE-MOMENTUM-101: weak bullish MS, distance between HHs and HL decreasing, weak momentum
MARKET-STRUCTURE-MOMENTUM-101: "krill-momentum-parabolic-rounded-top-like-loma-triple-dying3-MS-king.JPG"
HSAKA: He's very good at writing, so much so that he creates his own narratives
D1-SAFE-BUYS: If above all the D1-macro MAs and D1-ema13 is giving clean support, D1-ema13 is a very safe buy (1h39m)
D1-SAFE-BUYS: Especially if the coin is trending hard (ETC was the chart used to explain this)
D1-SAFE-BUYS: Very nice setup for folk that don't have a lot of time to trade
FVG: Ineffeciencies tend to get filled with very high probability
NARRATIVES: Very important and can cause a coin to pump hard, very good for pumps no use for dumps
HUBOI: doesn't trade there doesn't have enough volume now
GAINZY-RSI: Just uses the vertical bars to indicate a div or not (and these occur on any "div", doesn't have to be near extreme unlike CBS)
ALERT-SHARING: TradingView doesn't allow you to share your alerts (but you can share watchlists so other can import them) - something he's been asking TradingView for

------------------  Krill checklist  ---------------------
CHECKLIST: ma-cloud order
CHECKLIST: ma-cloud pointing up/down (angle = strength)
CHECKLIST: ma-gaps indicate trend strength
CHECKLIST: ma-trend catchup and act as support
CHECKLIST: price above macro MAs bullish
CHECKLIST: price below macro MAs bearish
CHECKLIST: stoch RSI reset (oversold)
CHECKLIST: MS HH HL HH HL
CHECKLIST: a strong support MA will point up
CHECKLIST: a strong resistance MA will point down

-- Update: See "Casading MA supports"
BEST: (1) H4-ema200 (best MA)
BEST: (2) D1-ema13 (2nd best MA)
SR: ema13/ema200 are the best MA SRs
SR: ma100/ma300 can be SR ONLY SR on H4 and D1
SR: ma100/ma300 only used for compressions on non H4/D1 timeframes
--
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Ride the Trend Fractally Across Timeframes
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: GENERAL CASE: m15-ema13 to H1-ema13 to H4-ema13 (to H1-ema200 / D1-ema8) to D1-ema13
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: Trending coins ride the trend fractally, riding LTF-trend successfully a few times, fail, bounce off HTF-trend below, then re-ride the LTF-trend
TREND-DOMINOS-EDU: eg: bounce off H1-ema13 successfully a few times, then fail, bounce off H4-ema13 as support, then back to riding H1-ema13

-- Krill close on trend reclaim (also Pierre)
RECLAIM: Krill will SL beyond 28ema (uses 13/21emas for trend)
RECLAIM: Pierre is more conservative (13/25/32emas for trend)
RECLAIM: Pierre will close position when "trend reclaimed", which is:
RECLAIM 1: break of AND retest of trend
RECLAIM 2: SR reclaim
RECLAIM 3: Stoch in extreme
See also: "krill-pierre-when-to-close-on-trend-reclaim-1.JPG"

-- Krill Ranges (when MAs are being chopped up)
RANGE: In choppy PA, Krill switches to Fib-SRs
RANGE: Adjust Fib so that levels match PA horizontal levels
RANGE: A bit like RP & Koz

-- HISTORY: From "Casading MA supports"
HISTORY: but must check what MA coin has reacted to before
H1-100MA: H1-100ma acts as support on some coins
H1-100MA: H1-100ma not respected by BTC as SR
H1-100MA-slope: H1-100ma slope gradient very informative (esp BTC)

--- EXECUTION: covers 90% of plays Krill uses
90%-OF-SETUPS: "krill-90percent-of-trades.JPG"
90%-OF-SETUPS: (1.0) Dump vix to H4 or D1 ema200
90%-OF-SETUPS: (2.0) Trend riding (trend ridden fractally across time-frames (dominos) (general and parabolic)
90%-OF-SETUPS: (3.0) Compression BO scam pump gap fill only (esp H1-banana to H4ema200), against the trend, see macro MA gaps and steepness
90%-OF-SETUPS: (3.5) reversal reclaim pattern with trend support for possible trend reversal (combination of 2 and 3)
90%-OF-SETUPS: (4.0) Range plays when MAs chopped 

-- EXECUTION
H1-TREND-CONTINUATION-STRATEGY: "krill-education-H1trend-continuation-setup1.png"
REVERSAL-RECLAIM: Starts reclaiming each of these macro/cloud MAs (1st ma100, then ema200, then ma300) while riding the trend
COMPRESSION-BO-SCAM-GAP-FILL: Compression BO scam pump gap fill only (esp H1-banana to H4ema200), against the trend, see macro MA gaps and steepness (DOGG)
TREND-RIDING: riding trend fractally across time-frames H1-trend to H4-trend (to H1-ema200/D1-ema8) to D1-trend; Pierre style
