Koz defi coins he likes & watching: snx, yfi, sushi, aave

BIG MARKET DUMP but coin stays in range = STRONG
BIG MARKET DUMP and coin recovers quickly = STRONG

BUY ON STRENGTH means dips below level and then reclaims it (SR / breaker)

If coin paints equal lows, he doesn't love that

Look at the weekly chart. Look for "inside weeks".
Was an inside week followed by a sweep of the lows and then a pump?

Koz is 23 (2021)

If you have a 5 year time-frame then buying BTC in the 30's (30k) should be very good. He's very bullish on these time-frames.

Levels he maps out; Koz methodology:
Monday's range
Weekly ranges
Weekly open
Monthly open
Key supply & demand area

Most traders fail because of execution

Mark the range
Swing the highs and lows
Intra-day scalps off bounces / pullbacks

Monday's highs & lows nearly always get taken when in a HTF range (not when trending)

He's German (Stuggart). Lived in West Africa and US. Dad from US.

Candles with no wicks (marubozo / flat bottom) get taken.

"Why is monthly open important"?
-The most basic way of looking at it
-Go to the monthly chart
-Month opens (MO), dips, red candle
-Reverses, rises above MO, candle flips green
now assume the low (bottom of monthly wick) is the low for the month
**So MO is just HTF SR**
When MO gets flipped, we expect it to continue to trend  
When MO gets flipped, we expansion away
-
Opens can also be used to give bias
Above monthly open = bullish
Below monthly open = bearish
"Opens are HTF SR"
-
Check BTC Yearly Open
Respected SR level & expands away when flipped
-
Can trade spot this way
BUY: when above YO
SELL: when below YO
-
Use 15m chart with DO

Think 5 years in future, was correct about crypto mooning, don't want to be on the sidelines chopped up / liquidated trying to get rich quick; slow and steady is key

He called down candle half-way up impulse a demand (which MB would call OB / reaccumulation) but said not good as it's not the ORIGIN of the PUMP (like RP says)
