"Krillin live stream for the Haven - Scanning and observing MA patterns on 4h and daily chart"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFVC0Mv89M ... WATCHED

Use this system to scan really quickly and flag interesting coin

ema13 (trend)
[[ema25 (trend)]] used by pierre, not krillian
H4-ema200 ("fastest")
ma100 (fast)
ema200 (slower)
ma300 (slowest)

Scan on daily chart, ready when
ema13 crosses above H4-200ema
ema13 & H4-200ema point up
COMPRESSION between H4-200ema & 100ma
100ma points up

MAs should point up to act as support and down to act as resistance. Wait for them to point up
--
BANANA pattern for ** full reset & trend reversal from down (bear) to up (bull)** should be in ascending order (bottom=ma100, middle=ema200, top=ma300)
BANANA pattern order will be opposite if strongly trending up (bullish) (bottom=ma300, middle=ema200, top=ma100) 
BANANA: fast MAs cross from below to above slow MAs=bull-up
BANANA: slow MAs cross from above to below slow MAs=bear-dwn
BANANA: 
Target will be the next ma, should be obvious, FILL THE GAP


manual SL on daily-timeframes for spot (avoid wicks)
Can layer bids to average down price
MAs should provide enough support for this

COMPRESSION between 100ma & 200ema usually leads to big candles; switch to D3 to check

Add in Fib levels for confluence too (on VERY HTF) - don't need other horizontal lines

Spot trade on daily chart; don't use binance futures

He uses H4 & D1 charts, but can use on any time-frame

Uses of MAs:
1. Tell the trend (up / down)
2. S/R levels
3. Compression and expansion
"Compression is all the MAs moving together into a tight beam"

Compression can occur below PA if PA is also consolidating == hint that explosive move soon

Hit rate very high if all the MAs go from descending to ascending

NB: He uses ema200 rather than ma200 as it guarentees it's between ma100 and ma300

"Krillin live stream for The Haven - Binance scan"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHx7JMcm03Y ... watched 2h20mins mins

34 mins: BAT/BTC perfect example of filling MA gaps with compression

Compression is ranging / ping-ponging between correct order MAs

BANANA compression in correct order for moon up:
ma100 bottom
ema 200 middle
ma 300 top
Compress / range in this correct order banana for pop up and then huge exansion above and beyond the ma300 (look for untapped highs far away)
Reasoning: Pre-empting the close / completion of the banana
(fast ma100 crosses the slower ema200/ma300; trend reversal)

Beautiful compression within banana (with clean PA) then strong breakout these are the best
Clean PA means reacting well with MAs

Bullish compression (point up, ma100 cross up)
Bearish compression (point down, ma100 cross down)

All MAs super tight = big move soon

LINK (& BNB) are two of the blue chips that you should be hodling

MA gets "reset" when it goes from falling to flat

He uses log scale quite a lot

If no (ma300 or ema200), switch on H4-ema200

Every coin is different. Sometimes a particular MA is just not relevant for a particular coin (eg: ma100 not relevant on PPT)

$5k "small bag" for fun scam pump coins




=====+++++===== My own notes
- The way we trade on Huobi is similar to Binance but there are a few differences:
- MA structure is the same:
H4-ema200-> D1-ma100 -> D1-ma200 -> D1-ema200 -> D1-ma300
(ma200 and ma300 might be at a different location, but the order that never changes is:
H4-ema200-> D1-ma100-> D1-ema200)

--
Slowbleed downtrend: MA gaps = FVG that will get pumped to and then retrace (against the trend trades)
Trend reversal: compression of long MAs and short MAs break above compression, get in on short MA retest (ema13/25)

Pierre: MAs like Price Action: Compression of slow MAs, fast MAs dump below these (sweep / SFP) then near vertical after this

Ping pong chop chop 

The angle of the ma100 at least needs to be flat / pointing up

Look back and see how the MAs are being respected (check different time-frames too)

If MA (ma100, ema200 or ma300) is acting as support in uptrend, keep buying support
If it is lost, don't "revenge trade", WAIT for COMPRESSION to re-enter

ema13/ema25 S/R on higher time-frames (D1+)

If price breaks out early from a forming banana compression, high chance it'll get retested from above

-- Krillin MA Theory Part 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U08mJ_oGyPY

ema13, H4-ema200, ma100, ema200, ma300
Bots use MA/EMAs as they are easy to calculate
MA/EMAs not used much in crypto
MAs define the trend:
- eg: price is above the MA
- eg: the MA is pointing up

An ascending MA will be strong support and weak resistance
A descending MA will be weak support and strong resistance

A "dip" is a retracement in an uptrend.

*** H4-ema200 is the absolute best one ***
*** D1-ma100 is second most important one ***
D1-ema13 starts pointing up AND being used for support
But H4-200ema is still sloping down and above therefore will be resistance so price still uncertain
Want to enter when price above D1-ema13 & H4-ema200 (and both pointing up) 

When all big D1 MAs are pointing down means bear market

HTF MA gaps equals trending

Reversal on D1: LTF (ema13 & H4-ema200) pointing up, ma300 starts to flatten, ema200 & ma100 start to rise giving a HTF MA banana compression.

1) Angle of MA (steep equals trend strength)
2) MA Pointing up or down
3) Compression of MAs
4) MAs (or compression) above or below price

Safer trade is to wait for the compression

Bollinger Bands derived from MAs, centre line is ma20.
MA/EMA compression is very like what BB does.

Compression is a sign of volatility

Highest hitrate (long):
Key MAs claimed as support
All MAs ascending
Compression is reaching its apex

V reversals are unlikely (even at a critical Fib)
Don't knife catch a dump to an MA, Fib (harmonics!)
Large moves occur after balance between supply and demand found and this occurs after a bit of time (wait for MA compression, don't expect V reversal)
The main purpose of compression if to avoid opportunity cost (don't wait too long for breakout / impulse)

Opportunity cost. Wait for compression of all MAs.
If most MAs are compressing but one isn't (eg: ma100 above and pointing down) then don't buy yet

PA & moving averages
Coin might be at support / demand
But there may be resistive MA nearby (above & pointing down) so perhaps just a little bounce from demand

Keep higher time-frame confluence in mind to maximise win rate
If using compression on H1 chart, check H4 chart
If using compression on H4 chart, check H12/D1 chart

Day-trading: H1-ma100 & H1-ema200 bullish retest

Scalping
After compression, we look for expansion of MAs (we know we're in an uptrend now)
Can scalp on 15m or H1 using ema21, ema34, ema55 catch wicks / retests on these emas (the one which is giving support)
ema55 is very strong for scalps
ema34 is very strong for scalps

What's his ema squeeze pattern? He says he will cover it later.

H4-ema200 used a lot by krill as support to protect his SL




=====+++++=====
-- Krillin MA Theory Part 2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCmxDomfzKE

Fractal nature of MAs (ie: same at different timeframes)

Continuation compression macro MAs (bullish continuation):
top: ma100, centre: ema200, bottom: ma300
Reversal compression macro MAs (reversal of bearish trend)
top: ma300, centre: ema200, bottom: ma100

ema200 should nearly always be in the middle of macro MAs because of how it's calculated

krill banana = MA cloud!
MA theory is very like Ichimoku!
Macro MA compression is a kumo twist!

Bottoming no longer making LLs
Classic PA (horizontal demand), opportunity cost. Demand may hold but choppy as macro MAs are decending and gapped.
May buy a bit higher but won't wait so long for break-out

If using ma200 as well as ema200:
correct macro order for strong bull trend:
top:ma100, ema200, ma200, bottom:ma300
(trend very bullish pulls ema200 up more than ma200)
-
correct macro order for strong bear trend
top: ma300, ma200, ema200, bottom:ma100
(trend very bearish pulls ema200 down more than ma200)
-
**TREND REVERSAL**
if bear trend going to banana reverse, ema200 should cross above ma200 as price rises/stalls to CREATE the compression
-
if bull trend going to banana reverse, ema200 should cross below ma200 as price dips/stalls to CREATE the compression
--
The trend is not fully reset / reversed until the MAs are in back in their correct order

See "krill-bullish-bearish-reversal-continuation-matrix1.JPG"

Trend reversal or continuation compression (H4 to D3)?
Bullish reversals will be bottoming patterns at the end of a long downtrend (flattened MAs)
Bearish continuation will be at the beginning of a downtrend (steep MAs)
Clue ema13: acting as resistance (bear) or support (bull)
Clue H1 zoom: need to reclaim ma100 to perhaps be bullish
Won't really know if continuation or reversal until MAs uncompress

ma200 can be a little funky
MAs are not lagging as they can be used to make accurate predictions
ma200 looks erratic compared to the other 3 macro MAs

Compression we want flat and tight macro (cloud) MAs

Pump. Consolidate. Macro MAs gapped. ema200 to be support, if not, to ma300 and ping-pong between ma300 & ma100. Either:
(1) wait for compression
(2) ma100 broken, get in on retest

If buying from H1 chart, always check H4 chart for resistance
If buying from H4 chart, always check D1 chart for resistance

--
SHORT MAs (my rainbow 6 emas, "ROYGBIV")
He doesn't use them on HTF, only on <=H4
Good for retests in trending market
Above or below price?
Pointing up or down?
In correct order? (if not, more chop)
Much more bullish if all emas in correct order, ascending and acting as support (break out impulse rather than small range pump)

EMA squeeze pattern
(42mins into video, see krill-ema-squeeze-pattern1.jpg)
Very flat macro MA/EMAs
All the short EMAs in correct order curling up
Increasing volume

Thinking of longing ma100 retest on <=H4?
Look at rainbow emas to see if below price, pointing up, correct order?

-Lazy mode 
MA cheat code (54mins, see krill-lazy-mode-cheat-code.jpg)
The lazy mode puts H4 & H1 MA/EMAs onto 1 chart for quick scan
Turn off all the candles! (remove price info!)
Long the supercross (all crossing flat H4ema200)
MA compression is best indicator of volatility
USE H4 CHART: My multi-indicator: ema13, ema25, ema34, ema55, ema100, (& H4-ma25==H1-ma100) & H4-ema200
Tight cluster of bullish crosses indicates volatility

-- Krillin Fibonacci Video
Fibs, no rule for using wick or bodies
Fib-range: Mostly saying use Fib levels as range
Fib-range: Match the Fib levels to PA S/R
Fib-range: Just like drawing range so great reaction from EQ
On savage dumps want to see bounce at 786
MA/EMA compression just needs to be a comparative narrowing of the MAs, not a full-on melding of them.
Can also use Fibs for TP targets

-- Krill DZ Journal Trade Analysis
Account staying the same is not bad (as you're paying fees so actually a slightly winning trader)
DZ having a green trade is special, he gets attached to it
RISK-FREE: Moving SL to BE means selling the dip
RISK-FREE: Put a post-it, "don't change SL without TPing"
RISK-FREE: TP1 at RR1 sell 50% trade
Capital is source of income, always preserve capital
TA gives an asymmetric RR in our favour (lose 1R, win 3R)
Krill is a day-trader
Krill will TP before bed (approx 30% to 50%)
You should always assume there will be a retest (diagonal, MAs, FVG)
We're gamblers playing with probabilities
I want to buy as close as possible to not being bullish anymore
Only look at 15m if you're a scalper
If you're careful and lock profit frequently you can get 1% per day; 1.01^365=37.8 (x38 your account in a year)
Always use "reduce only" TPs to prevent shorting after a SL
TP1: About 50% of trades will come back to entry after TP1
TP1: So can treat entry after TP1 as a compunding level
TP1: (if MAs still agree)
TP1: This will get you an additional 0.3R per trade
TP1: Brain thinks in linear way, but successful trader needs to think non-linearly for assymetric gambling
TP1: This could happen often, most don't V-reverse quick, you could be making multiple 1R trades before a V-reverse
ANALYSTS: Fine to copy analysts trades (entries good) ...
ANALYSTS: ... entry & invalidation/SL 2 most important things
ANALYSTS: ... think why their TPs are where they are ...
ANALYSTS: ... SR, MA gap, FVG, FTA/supply, Fib
ANALYSTS: but MAKE YOUR OWN PLAN, don't base on emotions
WEEKEND: Avoid weekend PA, often of reversed on Monday
DAILYPLAN-BTC: Krills daily plan is to give a bias for BTC, not to follow his squiggles exactly - BTC more chance of BULL than BULL, then look for good alt entries. If more bearish, then look to TP a bit more profits on alt trades
DAILYPLAN-BTC: It's Krill's BTC bias for that day and the next few days
LAYERING-BIDS: 1h36m: It's all about probabilities and math
LAYERING-BIDS: **It's the same R if only 1/3 entries hit**
LAYERING-BIDS: 1st bid should be for NO wick, other bids should be for a stinky wick down
LAYERING-BIDS: keep a note of how much lower than intial entry the trade went (0.2R, 0.6R, 0.99R)
LIMITS: Most of your trades should be waiting for limit bids to fill, don't be market buying unless swing/hodl
LIMITS: FTX no fee, BYBIT you get a little money for limits
TRADING 1. look at charts find good RR trades
TRADING 2. game theory: is this where people would buy or take profits?
TRADING 3: Execution plan for TPs (retest level then good for next level, what BTC doing?, don't babysit all the time, no stress.) Greater CONFIDENCE means greater CONVICTION means greater PATIENCE
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: Mostly H1 chart
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: He'll be doing TP1 full then reload at entry again a few times
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: He'll set important SR levels using D1 chart
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: Loma will do the same, use D1 for SR level, mix of D1 & H1, nails his entries, and it looks like magic
DAY-TRADE-KRILL: You cannot use 15m to find setups, use D1 mostly

-- Krill general notes
He is primarily a scalper.
Even when in a swing trade, he'll remove some and add it back in as it's ongoing (constant compunding)

10k to 1M (look for nano caps if you want ot 50x)
ICX bridging
NEAR bridging

### Scalping IGNORE
#Multi-timeframe scalping (overview, full video soon)
#D1 chart for bias / volatility
#H4 chart: compression = impulse
#H4 chart: no compression = ranging
#If H4 ranging, can scalp the 15m chart when there is a 15m #compression
#Ideal setup:
#Long D1 ema13 support while price ranging between H4ema100 & #H4ema300. Use H1ma100 or H1ema200 reclaim. Check slope of #MAs. Can also check short rainbow 6 emas curling up for #confluence.

-- New MAs
New MAs that appear are important. Bouncing on new MA is bullish (eg: ma300 has just appeared and bounced off of)

-- MA order importance
Macro MAs not in correct order, then less strong signal (shitty compression)
In weak market wait for more confirmation on longs**, less confirmation needed for shorts
In strong market wait for more confirmation on shorts, less confirmation needed for longs
** reclaim D1-ema13 (HH), then get in on HL (HL would be confirmation) Higher Low is confirmation of trend shift

-- Levels, including our entries, will get retested 20% of the time - a better hit rate than any indicator. Should TP partially then reenter on level / entry retest
"krill-dont-SL-at-BE-worst-mistake-TP-then-reenter-2.JPG"

-- What time of the day to trade
If swing trading, use daily chart, 2 hours per day, any time of the day, mark levels and wait / set limits
If day-trading/scalping, (1) scan at the beginning of your trading session, NYSE open and NYSE close
NYSE open = 1430
NYSE close = 2100
NYSE futures open = 2300

Futs: So just 40k in binance futures is all he needs 
MM: He only trades spot with exotic shitcoins in his metamask
EXE: He used to be good at TA but bad at trade execution
EXE: Now, will close 30%-50% before bed
EXE: If over-sizing trades, tend to exit at BE too much...
EXE: ..because PA is always choppy
EXE: should TP when happy / well in the green..
EXE: ..close 30%-50% of position..

SCAN: ..to catch nuke
REV: Reversal structure, first, reclaim ma100, then ema200, then ma300 and have ema13 as support each time
REV: Consolidate between MAs to allow ema13 to catch up
REV: This is what MA Theory is all about
DIAG: Parallel diagonals can give nice TP targets (ctrl-drag original support diagonal
SL: Have to put the stop below ema13 and H4-ema200
SL: Enter by estimating ema13 trajectory
CLEAN: Use the "cleanest" MA (the one that seems to be respected most
FIBS: pull Fib swing low to high (0, 236, 382, 500, 618, 786, 1) there should be a way of making the levels fit the PA very well (like Koz match range EQ)
FIBS: just roughly fit the Fibs to the price levels
SWINGS: Look to enter spot swings on ma300
DAYTRADE: Look at HTFs first, then H1 for entries
DAYTRADE: Krill is daytrader mostly on H1 chart
STOCH: He added Stoch RSI after Pierre's success with it
STOCH: Careful with Stoch without other confluence, it can remail oversold a very long time
CLEANCHART: He keeps only ema200 when scanning (removes ma100, ma300 and ema13)
H12: H12 timeframe is tricky, works on some coins but not on others (works on ETH)
CHOPPY-PA: If have a strong compression but price is choppy around it, then ignore compression, it is gone (would like to see a quick reaction)
CHOPPY-PA: If price is choppy, MAs can tell you if it's actually still trending up (correct order, point up)
TIME-FRAMES: Higher time-frame always prevails (D1, very occasionally D3)
TIME-FRAMES: Then look at H4 (and H1 when scalping)

15m ema200 == H4 13ema (200/4/4 = 12.5)
EXTEND: Extend MAs with brush to guesstimate SLs
EXTEND: Especially MAs that have interacted well with price
TREND: **ema13/21 must be clean continuous support before using it to buy daytrade ** especially with Stoch oversold
TREND: Don't trust trends/MAs that are being chopped by price
TREND: Want to use macro MAs for compression (excellent volatility indicators) and ema21 for entry / catch continuation
TREND-PLAYS: Trend is being chopped by price (eg: H4), when trend then acts as support the macro MAs will start expanding only on lower time-frames (eg: H1), can now enter trend on H4-ema21 and ride the trend (remember 15m-ema200 = H4-ema13 trend)
TREND-PLAYS: After this happens can enter on the next trend test
TREND-PLAYS: When you see this, higher probability for trend to continue rather than reverse
TREND-PLAY: Continue milking until higher time-frame resistance
REENTER: D1 trend or H4-ema200
GRADIENT: ma100 steep down = more chance resistance
H4: H4 time-frame is "short term swinging"
H4: 15m (scalp/daytrade), H12/D1 swinging. D3/W1 position
H4: H4-ema200 is the golden entry
SL: SL should be just below where you stop being bullish
ALERTS: set alerts so not affected by red candles that brought price back down to your zone; stick to your plan
ALERTS: !!Only take trades from alerts!!
ALERTS: Don't take trades based on emotions
TREND: If trend is accelerating, check lower time-frame to see if ema13 & ema21 are being very respected
H1: krill normally trades H1 middle time-frame, not good for scalps, not good for swings, "bastard timeframe"
H1: bastard time-frame, should only be used for fully compressed macro MAs
H1: hard to trade with krill's MA system
ma100 won't hold as support, to ema200, then ma100 acts as resistance.
H1: must always check D1 for resistance and levels
NOISE: when MAs on a time-frame are flat and getting chopped by price (never respected) ignore the MAs, they are just noise
NOISE: some time-frames might be noise (eg: H4 chop) but H1 might be clean
MA-users: MM, quants and bots are generally using MAs

ICT: ICT style is demand/supply/OB/breakers via MSBs
ICT: ICT and MA theory go very well together
ICT: Still using MSB, HH, HL
ICT: Flat MAs mean undeterminded MS, choppy not good, don't trade with MAs, range trading environment
ICT: So MAs and ICT go very, very well together, don't need to throw out ICT style levels if using MA theory
ICT: If MAs flat / ranging, zoom out
ICT: Goto HTF (D1, D3, etc) and mark SR levels as these ARE demand and supply level
ICT: ICT style is the best for forex, but CBS-style SR levels / pivots better for crypto as much more wicks / volatility
ICT: Don't just use MAs, must use MS / SRs too
ICT: Krill "Market structure is always King"
ICT: Going to have ridiculously good confluence between SRs and Krills MAs
ICT: Krill is a PA / MS trader who uses MAs to give well timed entries (opportunity cost, choppy price for a week while holding via leverage, likely to sell a mini-dump as opposed to mini-pump in the chop)

Trend: Trend shows where we can compound / reenter positions withing a forming banana
Trend: Krill typically spreads bids between ema13 and ema21 when riding the trend
Trend: When riding the trend, make sure ema200 not too close as it might struggle to break it easily and chop for a while
-
Plan: Need to plan and anticipate / assume, need to get in & anticipate / assume moves or we will miss them.
Plan: We will often see signs of banana compressions beginning to form on a higher timeframe
-
Fractal: MA theory is fractal in nature, H1-banana to a forming H4-banana (anticipate), this H4-banana will be in a forming D1-banana
Fractal: LTF Compressions are nested within HTF timeframe compressions
-
Playout: H1-banana (enter) to H4-ema200 resistance (sell); Krills normal scalping method
Playout: Now in forming H4-banana (we're anticipating this)
Playout: If H4-100ma is far away and trend is close, reenter on H4-trend, SR & HL after H4-200ema rejection (aim for H4-300ma)**
Playout: If H4-100ma is close and trend is close, look to enter more safely here (H4-100ma, H4-trend, SR & HL)
Playout: Break out of H4-banana aim for forming D1-banana (likely aiming to sell on steep D1-100ma resistance)
** HH, HL, HH, HL bullish market structure, look for HL entries with SR & MA confluence (we're PA traders)
-
Compression: Macro compression suggests both bias and timing
Compression: timing helps with oppertunity cost, paper-handing position and avoiding chop
Compressions: Compressions are not just when macros are "tight", it must be a banana shape
Compressions: Ideally want to enter the banana compression at its apex
Compressions: Compressions at apex at superior to diagonals
Compressions: Krill mostly daytrades H1 charts on leverage so does not want to see chop
Compressions: H1-banana near apex should give pump soon (opportunity cost)
-
Angles: Very descending MA means high chance at being resistance
Angles: Flat MA means high chance at being broken and turned to support (flipped)
Angles: Ascending macro MA beneath (eg: H4-100ma) means bullishness confluence
-
SL: Krill sets tight SLs not using ATR, but looking at recent bigger wicks down. Recent bigger downwicks will give an indication of book thickness so use these to judge where to set tight SL.
SL: Will definitely expect banana compression to hold, so very tight SL using recent downwicks as tolerance
SL: Trend, should hold on 2nd and subsequent taps, use recent downwicks for SL tolerance setting
SL: The stronger the trend (later tests), the tighter the SL
SL: At trend start (less tested) use wider SL
-
RR: Krill has tight stops, high RR, will get stopped out quite a bot. But when everything starts very trending, he'll have high winrate and ridiculous RR ratios
-
BO: Krill doesn't usually play breakouts (perhaps if **volume high**)
-
PumpHL: Saw huge pump on ICX (biggest gainer of the day) so asks where is the next likely HL (D1/H4 for SR, look at H1 chart with compresssion at the SR for his entry / trigger)
-
Info: Krill started using MAs early 2019, 3 years now. Started using compression 6 months before he created The Haven

=====************************************************=====
------------------  Krill checklist  ---------------------
ma-cloud order
ma-cloud pointing up/down (angle = strength)
ma-trend catchup and act as support
price above macro MAs bullish
price below macro MAs bearish
stoch RSI reset (oversold)
MS HH HL HH HL
a strong support MA will point up
a strong resistance MA will point down
-
(1) H4-200ema (best MA)
(2) D1-100ma (2nd best MA)
Buy when price above H4-ema200  & above D1-100ma
Buy when H4-ema200 & D1-ma100 pointing up
D1-13ema (daily trend) important too consider when trading H1 & H4
