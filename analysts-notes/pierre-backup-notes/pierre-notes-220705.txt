=== Many MAs on one indicator (just use Krill's script instead)
INDICATOR: Name of the indicator: "Andre's 8EMA+8MA+BB+Ichimoku"
INDICATOR: here's the Youtube video he made back then to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=almTrFf3Q3c
INDICATOR: I'll share this in the last piece of my educational content!  All showed here on this chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/NiOAr20y/

=== Stoch info and using Stoch to adjust full risk
STOCH: My Stoch Notes from Web:
STOCH: Stoch RSI moves faster than RSI (from overbought to oversold)
STOCH: Stoch RSI is not good in choppy / range-bound market; too many false signals
TREND: Stoch is for trending coins
TREND: Pierre is trend trader only
TREND: says he's not good at ranges (MAs flat and getting chopped through)
CALC: Compare current RSI with LOWEST RSI in lookback
CALC: Scale this comparison by RSI range size
RISK-TRENDING: If price approach SR & trend from below and Stoch overbought - go full risk short
RISK-TRENDING: If price approach SR & trend from above and Stoch oversold - go full risk long
RISK-CHOP: If in stong downtrend and Stoch goes from oversold to overbought without claiming above SR / trend - full risk short
RISK-CHOP: If in stong uptrend and Stoch goes from overbought to oversold without claiming below SR / trend - full risk long

=== Pierre's simple methodology (in order of priority)
METHOD: Pierre's simple 3 point method:
METHOD: (1) Horizontal S/R flips and/or pivot 
METHOD: (2) Trend (13/25 EMA)
METHOD: (3) Stoch RSI at cycle low
METHOD: ---
METHOD: Ideally:
METHOD: Breaks above a horizontal SR
METHOD: Breaking this SR causes StochRSI into overbought
METHOD: Consolidate above SR (TraderSZ) allowing trend to catch up (Krill trend-consolidation-pattern / "flag")
METHOD: "krill-trend-consolidation-pattern1.JPG"
METHOD: Consolidate above SR allowing StochRSI to reset
METHOD: Long to catch next leg up
CANDLES: He uses candle closes, not wicks, to mark SR levels
TREND-TRADER: Pierre is a trend trader, not good at ranges

=== Pierre's Simple Trend System for going with MS
METHOD: Pierre's simple 3 point method is designed to long on HH, HL, HH, HL structure, buying on a HL
METHOD: ---
METHOD: (A) Entering long on HL using horizontal and trend
METHOD: (i) Horizontal pulled from prev high ("must hold")
METHOD: (ii) If horizontal held, long will be a from HL
METHOD: (iii) Bullish trend (pointing up)
METHOD: (iv) trend retest buy will be a from a HL
METHOD: (v) Enter on the SECOND retest of horizontal & trend, NOT THE FIRST, let market structure establish itself
METHOD: (B) Stoch used to help with timing (and risk adjustment)
METHOD: ---
METHOD: Horizontal and trend are designed so that the trade goes with the prevailing & established market structure & trend
METHOD-SUMMARY: Stoch is used to help with timing

=== Pierre use of MAs
MA-USAGE: Mostly uses trend EMAs (13, 25 & 32), not macro MAs
MA-USAGE: He uses MAs for bias (pointing up/down, steep/shallow, gaps between MAs, MA order)
MA-USAGE: Macro MAs can be used for SLs and TPs
MA-USAGE: Krill: Can judge relative performance between cons on their ability to hold MAs (eg: coin X held H4-ma100 on the dump but coin B didn't - look for shorts on coin B)
