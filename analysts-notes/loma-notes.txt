Loma — 27/04/2021
REALITY-CHECK: @everyone really quick a reality check before I drive to my cabin for the week:

REALITY-CHECK: Have patience.

REALITY-CHECK: We will have more and more of these 20-40% pullbacks on ALTs on the way up. It WILL happen. Your goal isn't to be an overnight financial success. The likelihoods of that are extremely thin.

REALITY-CHECK: What you're looking to do is this: 
- Compound gains consistently
- Don't lose money on those 20-40% pullbacks
- Make more money on the recovery

REALITY-CHECK: Don't get sucked into the poor man's situation. It's ironic because people want to be rich so they take on more risk which only keeps them poor.

REALITY-CHECK: Break free of that mentality. I know it's not very intuitive but you have to understand that risking more, betting big and other forms of improper management is how you actually stay broke in a bull market.
This is how you win.

REALITY-CHECK: You stack boring 5-10-15% bangers consistently and don't lose 50% of your portfolio when the market turns against you.
You take a small crack on the chin, maybe a 5-10% loss and then move forward.
There's NOTHING admirable about making 1m and then losing 900k on the dump.
I'd rather make 250k and lose 20k.
1. Less stressful
2. Proper risk management keeps you alive should the dump actually be the top.
You don't want to be one of those people that make millions in a bull market, have like 10x leverage and see it omega dump 30% only to liquidate your portfolio.
Think of it like boxing or MMA, you can have insane offensive capabilities but without defense, you're going to get exploited sooner or later.

The Market of Madness - Endless Range (with CBS)

D1: Large wicks are where liquidations have occurred (perhaps cascade liquidations)

EXEC-EXPERT: He always uses a hard stop
EXEC-EXPERT: Even if it's a huge SL for black swan protection, not really for trading
EXEC-EXPERT: Krill says Loma is an execution expert
EXEC-EXPERT: Chat said he has both discretionary and hard SLs, he rarely takes full 1R loss on a trade (cuts, adds, cuts, adds, adds, etc)
TRADES: He mostly plays SR flips
HTF-LEVELS: He uses Weekly & D3 to determine his bias to trade lower time-frames
PSYCH: CBS & Loma said hardest thing to do is get back in after being stopped out (instead of reversing bias)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: loma-slope-gradient-momentum.png
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling medium slope
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling steep slope (puts in bottom)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling tiny slope (rounded bottom)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Momentum rounded out

=====*****
RANGE-PATTERNS: In a range bound environment; cheesy patterns tend to work (eg: channel)

Support and Resistance Workshop by "The Haven"
TA: SR = supply/demand = OBs = FTA = buy/sell walls
TA: Different names for the same concepts
TA: Loma uses swing high/lows SHSL
TA: Swing low: mark the low of the candle that gets swept
TA: Swing low: the sweep candle should go into an important area 
TA: What is support... just look at the chart (lies, choppy)
LIES: the chart / numbers do not lie
LIES: naratives lie, people lie, govs lie, 
LIES: lot harder to manipulate action than it is narratives
SLBE = Stop Loss to Break Even
CHOPPY-AREA: Choppy area = cluster
CHOPPY-AREA: Choppy areas = lot buying and selling & market participants
CHOPPY-AREA: up from chop = support
CHOPPY-AREA: down from chop = resistance
CHOPPY-AREA: support/demand, if price comes back, initial...
CHOPPY-AREA: ..buyers have TPd on way up & SLBE...
CHOPPY-AREA: ..don't bid the top of the demand zone
CHOPPY-AREA: DON'T BID THE TOP OF SUPPORT
CHOPPY-AREA: ..there will be wicks down to take the SLBEs
CHOPPY-AREA: ..will have been many buyers IN the choppy area
CHOPPY-AREA: ..demand is always a range...
CHOPPY-AREA: Martyn marks demand zone using Fib / OTE range
CHOPPY-AREA: bid 5%, 5%, 5%, 5%, down to 30% @ bottom
CHOPPY-AREA: SLBE at demand top TRIGGERS selling wick down
CHOPPY-AREA: psycology of people SLBE (profits have disappeared)
CHOPPY-AREA: someone is acting out of necessity and we just took their liquidity, we act on their demise, us and the exchange should be taking their money as they're liquidated, it's a zero sum game
CHOPPY-AREA: the more normal higher liquidity coins has more new traders who SLBE
CHOPPY-AREA: want to areas with lots of market participants (perhaps VOLUME (on HTF on liquid coins))
CHOPPY-AREA: downwards / upwards / sideways chop
LOMA-ZONE: marking the bottom of the choppy area!
LOMA-ZONE: Krill: "Loma nails his entries"
LOMA-ZONE: Loma's zones will be choppy
LOMA-ZONE: Lots of red candles in a chop, buy quick retest of this zone
ACTIVE-MPs: Active market participants
ACTIVE-MPs: This is where we want to buy
ACTIVE-MPs: The older the levels, the less they matter (participants will have TPd already)
ACTIVE-MPs: Lots of green candles in a row will have active participants TPing on the way up, moving their stops
ACTIVE-MPs: Look at recent levels, not "my 1.618 Fib"
RESISTANCE: Resistance in bull market is different to resistance in a bear market (not many participants)
Res: Support is a lot more common in a bull market (lots of touches of support)
RESISTANCE: Will usually have a big wick through the swing high resulting in Loma's SHSL resistance zone (wicks above but closes below; people (buyers) will be trapped here)
RESISTANCE: If price starts trading (opening and closing) above this SHSL resistance, then expect it to pump if bull market
RESISTANCE: He marks the wick tops at swing highs for resistance
RESISTANCE: When price travels to the highs but fails to close above, this is resistance
RESISTANCE: Trapped BO traders "please just let the price come back to near my entry and I will get out!"
RESISTANCE: You don't always need an OB, months/weeks of partcipants to tell the range
RESISTANCE: look for follow-through and go with that trend
RESISTANCE: You HAVE to be taking profits on the way up or you're just NGMI as a trader
RESISTANCE: resistance in bull market is normally formed by (i) people shorting (not so much this) (ii) people who bought then got trapped (much more this)
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: when drawing SR, keep in back of mind why it's there and build your own narative (eth 2.0 out, btc ATH pulled eth up, visa news, elon tweet tesla) - helps you understand the market
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Fundamentals drive techs in a bull market
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Put a narrative to things as it is reflected in the technicals
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Fold get in on FA news (tesla accepting btc) and this will create a TA level
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: He won't trade the charts on Uniswap as it's too easily manipulated due to low liquidity, no narrative
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: could be as simple as prior ATH
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: most of the money you make is going to come from average traders, you're not taking money from CZ, Sam, Bezos, Gates. etc
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Natural human reaction, hate losing, so move SLBE
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: He mostly bids the mid to low part of the choppy range
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Put yourself into the shoes of a new, average or intermediate trader and ask "what are they feeling right now?", ecstasy, fear? What's the counterparty feeling?

HISTORY: He's been in crypto since 2015 (a little) and a lot since 2017 (in college)
BULL: What will fcuk you up in a bull market is the volatility
BULL: Fade your euphoria
BULL: He's had friends "make it" within a few months; holding only small coins spot, not leverage (few thousand to million+)
OBs: Should be buying consolidations
PSYCH: Don't leave your non-moving coin at support to jump risk-on to the big green candle

SHIB: shib is indicative of the whole alt market
SHIB: Doge & Shib won't pump together coz they share liquidity

--
Twitch stream 211120
Bottoms form when people stop market selling, not when people market buys. Check gradients.
Ask if you took the trade 100 times, would it make money?

-- Twitch 211215
He doesn't like demands for trending alts, doesn't want to see the pump fully retracted
Hardly any V reversals, but mellow out / consolidate / gradient less steep
BNB always performs decently, binance is legit, should always hold BNB spot
Loma normally trades at H4 or H1
People that come up as good traders come from bear markets
Treat it like a video game, don't think about money value, it's a process (think of R). Risk 2% or 3% at a time. Make CONSISTANTLY good decisions.
Can use full candles or just bodies to mark his OBs (SHSLs)

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.2: HAVE WE BOTTOMED? 220128
WICKS: Horizontal lines should be drawn from the wicks
WICKS: Big wicks indicate emotion, ppl making irrational decsions
WICKS: Can only be so many sweeps of lows before failure (WW style)
CAPITULATION: Capitulation wick is like computer factory reset (OI goes, funding reset)
CAPITULATION: Big difference between capitualtion and continuous selling
S&P: S&P bounce to 4600 you should sell
PAIR-CHARTING: JEWELWAVAX*AVAXUSDT (or JEWELAVAX/AVAXUSDT) (or FTTUSDT/SRMUSDT to get FTT/SRM)
PAIR-CHARTING: Two pairs duel combined coins tokens tradingview trading view cross pair conjoined twinned 
OBs: Too far back not good, buyers that created it won't be there
OBs: Use the freshest OBs, they're most significant
OBs: Unless there is big news that created the support / demand
INFO: Master the process then the money will come
INFO: Risk on when uptrending, risk off when downtrending

=====  Loma's Lounge Ep.7: RUSSIAN INTO POSITIONS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXcHN3aVCJ4
MS: Market structure is important but needs rest of the market to be good too (good MS for alt and BTC looks like shit useless) 

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.8: Bitcoin Decorrelates From Stonks?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoTpfFTd5CQ
BIG-CANDLE: The top of a big down candle will be strong resistance on the way back up; ie: stong supply zone
SL: Place SL above two levels of resistance (loma-put-SL-above-2-levels-of-resistance1.JPG)
SWEEP: Taking out highs (sweep) should be surgical and quick. There should be follow through down. Enter on follow through down with SL above the highs

TRENDLINE: EMAs help with trend line
PAIRED-TRADE: KNCUSDT/AVAXUSDT

===== 220311 Loma's Lounge Ep.11: FRIDAY SPECIAL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HizotFUkGgE
PUMPS: Big pumps with full retrace is BEARISH, lack of momentum
TIMEFRAMES: Establish H1 level (via D1) then goto 15m to refine
WEAKNESS: Mult pushes up, full retrace, then LH
WEAKNESS: see: EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM
SFP: SFP on multiple timeframes with follow through = strong signal = sfp confirmed
RSI: He doesn't use as other indicators will have already confirmed it by the time rsi confirms
LEADING: If recent leading coin is dumping, then whole market market will dump
WHALE: average whale ahs 20-40 million usd
EXIT: Whale exit pump = impulse up then immediate retrace
EXIT: Last squeeze, little coin in bear market, artificial
RETEST: not MS demands as this is full retrace
RETEST: Using SR levels (like CBS) better
RETEST: impulse, full retrace (to demand), weaker bounce (LH), then big dump well below demand
ENTRY: 10%, 20%, 20%, 50%

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.12: Return of the Bull?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEv3EaBe-h4

LOMA: About 1 hour in discusses Loma's method
LOMA: Execution expert
LOMA: Wide entries to scale in
LOMA: Wide exits to scale out
LOMA: De-risks on pump
LOMA: Re-adds on dump
LOMA: Trades big size so has to slowly scale like this
LOMA: strength based on daily charts
LOMA: but more trades on lower timeframes for pumps / dumps
LOMA: range trading to build big position for nuke
LOMA: if nuke doesn't come he'll be OK since scaling in and out a lot
LOMA: If he posts daily chart basically need to scale in all the way between his entry and his stop
LOMA: This is how he can counter-trend trade successfully, large scaling in and derisking quickly, adding again to compound
LOMA: Great for learning to improve execution

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.20: GOBLIN TOWN INCOMINGGGGGGG

VOL: Large volume indicates climax
4THINGS: PA, risk management, volume, rsi divs
4THINGS: You only need to master 4 distinct things
4THINGS: not be a master of all and you can beat market
COMPOUNDING: Essentially just taking a new trade, can treat as such

Loma's Lounge: JULY 4TH WEEKEND 220702
FAVORITE: "Our favorite setup" (high, sweep, sweep, LH, LH)
FAVORITE: Atom example, short on the LHs
FAVORITE: Gradients showing waning momentum
FAVORITE: "loma-favorite-setup-sweep-sweep-LH-LH-short1-atom.png"
SZ: Loma uses SZ style (enter higher on reclaim on RH or lower on deviation of RL)
SZ: Consolidation above the highs (horizontal level) is good for a long
MS: Use HTF (daily) for market structure (not H4)
DEFENCE: Correct way to learn to trade is defensive strategy first, risk management
DEFENCE: Many make lots of money, but few can keep it (Su Zhu 9 billion in profits, but can't hold onto it)
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Visual test, pumps and pull backs
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Pumps get smaller and retraces gets deeper
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: First pump big wih shallow pullback, 2nd pump smaller with deeper pullback, 3rd pump smaller with bigger pullback
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: momentum is waning
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Check this HTFs (H4 at least)
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: So his demand/supply is about momentum, not blocks
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: "loma-demand-supply-momentum-game-thoery-GMT-1.JPG"
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: (SF: check with RSI and AO)
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: game thoery of demand/supply, demand is decreasing supply increasing thus reducing momentum
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: "loma-triple-drive-dying-momentum-example-and-bull-pennant-example.png"
TA: Just get 3/4 things that go "hand-in-hand", don't learn too much or you'll get conflicted; get good at execution
JOURNEY: The journey of a trader is to make money! Feelings, opinons, likes, DOES NOT MATTER, only go for best performing asset and squeeze the most money as possible from ut

===== https://youtu.be/pty51g4aOHU
LOMA: The After July 4th Special
SOL-PROXY: Sol, now determines the health of the alt market
SOL-PROXY: Sol, new-ish, large market cap
SOL-PROXY: Sol better than eth as proxy for alt-coin health now in Loma's opinion
INVALIDAION: At a pivot between a long and a short, take the trade with the easy invalidation
INVALIDATION: Like SZ, taking this trade because there's clear invalidation
INVALIDATION: Invalidation (SL) should be where we'd flip bias
INVALIDATION: Don't want to get stopped and have the same bias, means either (i) shit entry or (ii) risked too much
INVALIDATION: Think as a bi-directional trader
BEST-SETUPS: Good rule of thumb
BEST-SETUPS: The best long setups are failed short setups
BEST-SETUPS: The best short setups are failed long setups
BEST-SETUPS: "loma-best-long-setups-are-failed-short-setups1.JPG"
INVALIDATION-SZ: He's really like TraderSZ
INVALIDATION-SZ: EG: Short just below SR, short more at SR, short even more just above SR (assume deviation,invalidation VERY close now), close on long trigger of SR reclaimed as support
STAIRS-UP: Staircase up pattern never ends well
STAIRS-UP: stairs up, elevator down
STAIRS-UP: "loma-staircase-up-never-ends-well-elevator-down1.png"
STAIRS-UP: When it takes weeks to grind up constantly (people start to become a bit greedy) then gets utterly rugged in a couple of days with brutal red candles, VERY bearish

"Loma's Lounge: Bear Market Rally or Reversal?"
MANY-SETUPS: "loma-BTC-levels-setups-nice-and-wide-likeSZ.jpg"
MANY-SETUPS: This stream shows exactly how he creates his setups; this is exactly how he does it
RANGE-DRAWING: can be drawn with rectangles (less accurate zones), don't need exact trend-lines
RANGE-DRAWING: Range EQ doesn't have to be exactly 50%, can use rectangle zone not quite at 50%
MAJORITY: Markets like to fuck with the majority
BUYBACK-WICK: Placing SL below a buyback wick is very good
POINT-OF-TA: Allows you to identify how prices act to certain levels and identify when you're wrong
POINT-OF-TA: THIS is what TA is for (not pretty drawn rectangles from candle etc)
POINT-OF-TA: If not doing this,may as well use market profile to just go with the flow of the market (long at trapped seller levels and short and trapped longer levels)
GAMING-COINS: Newer gaming coins are always better, HYPED!
GAMING-COINS: These are only as good as their last pump
LOW-LIQUIDITY: Low liquidity coins dangerous; difficult to get out without slippage of an extra 2-3% on your SL
PSYCH: If you're good to the game, it'll be good to you
PSYCH: HTF, makes a higher low, you might e scared, but you have to trust the PA (don't trust CT, articles)
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (1) study the charts, learn PA
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (2) Go and apply it
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (3) Need to do it yourself
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (4) sit your ass down and LEARN

PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (6) Lower position sizes
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (7) LEARN, skill development
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (8) The money will follow
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (9) Focus on the process, not the  results or money
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (10) Discipline and sacrifice, you need to sacrifice a lot to get good at this
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (11) Gave this spiel as folk are asking him for setups, and then getting rekt, because this is not what you're meant to be doing
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (12) If you can't do this, UNSUBSCRIBE from The Haven and come back when the market is easy (market i shard right now)
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (13) there is no TA that is magically going to get you a 60% win-rate, you need to put in the hours and be adaptable, do it yourself
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (14) "assymetrical betting": trust yourself, your analysis, bet 2% of portfolio to win 10%
LOMA-HISTORY: Loma did EW, Fibs, patterns - all useless
LOMA-HISTORY: Look at things as how they are, not what you want them to be
LOMA-HISTORY: Took him two years of trying different stuff to finally get very good

HODL: SYNAPSE is a good long term play, accumulate now for next bull market (he liked using it, one of the best bridges he's used, tokenomics good too)
FOMO: You want to be in coins people are FOMOing into, fuck support, they're front-running support by 3%
FOMO: Do you want people to wait for lower prices to buy (no!) or do you want them to be fomoing in?
LADDER-ENTRIES: Pyramid entries, small to big, in OB / SR.
LADDER-ENTRIES: Want a little exposure if it pumps from top of rectangle (SR / OB), about process, managing risk
LADDER-ENTRIES: Not full position size on every trade
LADDER-ENTRIES: Full position should be reached at area where your comfortable getting filled at

CANDLE-RANGE: Use the candle that breaks out of the range as the range to ladder entries to long
CANDLE-RANGE: "loma-use-candle-that-broke-out-of-range-as-range-to-buy1.png"
WATCHLIST: Should be full of top performers and / or newer coins
TRADE-EXECUTION: Loma discussion 220811, Blacksphere
TRADE-EXECUTION: "Dynmaic position sizing with fixed risk"
TRADE-EXECUTION: Handling layered entries not filled
TRADE-EXECUTION: Adding to winning position
TRADE-EXECUTION: Dealing with layered entries giving full SLs but partial wins if not all entries hit on a winning trade
TRADE-EXECUTION: "loma-sizing-layered-entries-and-adding-blacksphere-7-mq-chart-example.JPG"

EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Loma execution style posted trades
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Loma catches BOUNCES first, not going for reversal
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Wide SL with layered weighted entries  (trying to catch wick right next to invalidation for biggest entry, but not always accomplished)
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: First TP usually less than 1R from first entry (BOUNCE catch)
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Second/third TP may aim for possible reversal
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: So high win-rate with lots of small winners (not all entries hit and only TP1 hit)
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Occasional home-run (all entries hit, huge position built right next to invalidation (very tight stop on the final biggest entry position))
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Lots of small nibbles, occasional Michelin Starred meal

LAYERED-ENTRIES: New journal 220901, new entry approach?
LAYERED-ENTRIES:
"loma-decreasing-exponential-entries1.JPG"
LAYERED-ENTRIES: These seem to have big initial entry then smaller extra entries (I presume layered, increasing size as it goes deeper into SL trying to catch wick)
LAYERED-ENTRIES: ..he norally says start small then add more and more, bigges add right next to invalidation, try for very very lucky entry

OB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUgvJOWEScc  (46 minutes)
OB: "loma-OB-how-he-draws-and-uses-orderblocks-1.JPG"
OB: Takes the most significant areas in his opinion
OB: He uses OBs as support and resistance
OB: But SR means nothing if not put into context
OB-SUPPLY: DOWN candle open after pump (HIGHEST CLOSE)
OB-DEMAND: UP candle open after dump (LOWEST CLOSE)
OB: He likes to have them there, but they're not auto buys or sells
OB: Uses them as a supplement to what he sees going on in the market
OB: Don't buy at the begining of a LOMA-OB, buy after it's been successfully swept
OB: Just because something is at support does not mean you have to buy it
OB: Just because something is at resistance does not mean you have to sell it
OB: Looking for specific reactions (eg: Koz style sweep and reclaim) - much better area to enter than demand top

BACKTESTING: Don't need to backtest, market condtions always changing, understand the TA you use and adapt that to the market condtions.

HARD-STOPS: don't need hard stops after TPing
HARD-STOPS: "loma-no-hard-stops-after-TPing.JPG"

EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: FULL-BREAKDOWN: "loma-triple-drive-dying-momentum-full-breakdown2.JPG"

METICULOUS: Loma: "good" trading should be meticulous and dull. Careful analysis, copied over and over again.
It's hard but boring if that makes sense, like doing taxes
METICULOUS: "loma-profitable-trading-is-boring-meticulous-and-repetitive.JPG"

SWEEP: A sweep only matters if there is continuation (FOLLOW-THROUGH)

SPELL-RETEST: The low of the consolidation that led to the high before the PoB on HIGH TIME FRAME LEVELS
SPELL-RETEST: "loma-spell-low-of-consolidation-retest.png"

DAILY-ROUTINE: "loma-daily-routine-check-top-10-coins-and-narratives-and-checkFeed.png"

DISTRIBUTION: Distribtion is sweep plus slowinging momentum
DISTRIBUTION: "loma-distribution-is-sweep-and-slowing-momentum.png"

CHECK: Loma checks trades he's in every 5 minutes

FRAMEWORK: TA is a framework to manage market perspective and manage risk
FRAMEWORK: No-one says TA is 100 or 80%, it is truely a coin-flip if trading 50 or 60% hitrates 
FRAMEWORK: Important as TA tells you when you are wrong, so can still make money even with 40 or 50% hitrate
FRAMEWORK: TA could be EW, FA new, MP, moon cycles, OI - just a way to understand the market

JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: Started with $1M, up 50% a month later, no 30% winners, just 5% here, couple% there
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: Loma calls this slow and steady!
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: Doesn't matter if miss 3 or 5 setups, irrelevant
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: Sometimes the right approach doesn't win, focus on the PROCESS, be PATIENT..
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: ..don't TILT, make consistantly good decisions (9/10), don't focus on results
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: slow and steady, don't try and get rich quick
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: Bear market is just in and out, try and compound a bit here and there
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: Bull market is when you get your 10x, 20x and 30% trades
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: difficult market, move slow, bet small, get in sync with market..
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: ..start nailing trades (big coins, btc, eth, etc), then go hard (introduce smaller alts)
JOURNAL-GOAL-SEP2022: See gdrive loma-trade-recaps-sept2022 folder.. makes it look so easy up 50% in a month

EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: MQ: Use Heikin Ashi candles / RSI / AO?
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: MQ: "loma-triple-drive-dying-momentum-heikinAshi-1.png"

LOMA-TA: I actually employ probably the most basic of TA, but it comes down to refining discretionary..
LOMA-TA: ..skills and general market intuition that does it for me.
LOMA-TA: "loma-not-good-at-TA-but-discretionary-skills-and-market-intuition.png"

CEO: If CEOs are stepping down, it's because they don't see a bull market soon (they stay for bull markets)

CASH: Holding cash is essentially a 1x short

LUCKY-LIKELY: "Aim for lucky entries and likely exits"

BEAR-MARKET: Need to adapt mindset from bull (easy) to bearish market. Either sit out and preserve capital, or mostly short

HERD: Don't following the apeing herd after tweet, if they've all bought, who's going to buy it after me? Everyone's already in
HERD: Shilling a coin like RSR, that has 75k position size limit on binance (ie: no liquidity), it's going to die hard after the shill

FVG-TA: Don't need them, probably doing too much TA is using them
FVG-TA: All you need is SR and discretionary info
FVG-TA: If understand SR, you're in full control of the standard colors, add in discretioary (some PA know how) and profit. That's all
FVG-TA: discretionary: buyers need to step in here to stop chart looking awful (clean invalidation)
FVG-TA: discretionary: sellers need to step in here to chart breaking out (clean invalidation)

LADDER-ENTRIES: "If your normal position size is 200k, then enter 100k here and 100k here.."
LADDER-ENTRIES: "..give avg entry of X, SL 3%, potential TP 10%, that's a good R trade"

ONE-DIRECTION: He used to get chopped a lot when he started trading.. road to profitability was to only focus..
ONE-DIRECTION: .. taking one direction in his trades.. either just long or just short, don't long and short

SR: Always mark the high of the last EXPANSION up
SR: (Always mark the low of the last EXPANSION down)
SR: Use the Higher High Lower Low Live indicator for these (like RP "uses" of his vHTF OBs); clear swing points
SR: "loma-SR-always-box-the-last-expansion-up-or-down1-crv.png"
SR: Likes to focus on the area just before PoB to mark SR bloc

FOLIO-SIZE-100M: Q: "Loma, are you at 9 figures?". A: "Barely"

SFP-FOLLOW-THROUGH: SFP confirms on candle close
SFP-FOLLOW-THROUGH: Follow-through confirms if NEXT candle closes below the LOW (wick) of the SFP candle
SFP-FOLLOW-THROUGH: Follow-through also referred to as continuation
SFP-FOLLOW-THROUGH: "loma-sfp-with-follow-through-continuation-explained.png"
SFP-FOLLOW-THROUGH: "loma-lowest-close-should-give-the-bearish-restest-NO-FOLLOW-THROUGH-so-weak-here.png"

SLEEP-EXECUTION: For his journal trades, doesn't go to sleep with trades open (because he uses discretionary stops)

TERMINOLOGY: Yo
TERMINOLOGY: Bro
TERMINOLOGY: Peace
TERMINOLOGY: Narrative
TERMINOLOGY: The juice ain't worth the squeeze

DECISIVE: When something decisive happens after price has been indecisive, tend to continue (not look back)
DECISIVE: eg: 3 month range broken out of, will look for it to continue up
DECISIVE: "loma-decisive-move-out-of-long-range.png"

DISCRETIONARY-SL: Start buying just above SR, buy at SR, hopeful catch of wick below SR.
DISCRETIONARY-SL: If start closing below the SR though, start reducing position size
DISCRETIONARY-SL: "loma-discretionary-SL-hard-and-soft-example.png"

PoE: Point of expansion level / SR
PoE: "loma-Po3-PoE-point-of-expansion.png"

COMPARISON: Loma expert at comparing coins in his head (SUSHI has broken out of 2 month range, CRV is still in its 2 month range)..
COMPARISON: ..so CRV chart looks shit (weak) even though just still ranging
COMPARISON: only want to buy chad coins

SIMPLE: Keep is simple, SR reclaimed, long, SR lost, short
SIMPLE: It's emotions that ruin trading results
SIMPLE: Best longs are failed shorts and best shorts are failed longs
SIMPLE: TT style? Keep longing reclaim of level and keep shorting loss of level?
SIMPLE: "loma-point-of-expansion-example-ENS-just-keep-it-simple-TTstylePerhaps.png"

FUTURES-LISTING: Introduces whole range of new traders that trade long and short (as opposed to long only on spot)
FUTURES-LISTING: Like introducing a new species into an ecosystem
FUTURES-LISTING: When SBF list new perp (from previous spot only) it's down only from that point

WHAT-TO-TRADE: He only looks at top 15 or 20 by volume on binance
WHAT-TO-TRADE: Wants to see good liquidity (not super wicky, as these need wide stops and small position sizes)
WHAT-TO-TRADE: What looks good, top performers, newer coins with narrative

HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: Loma end of stream rant on question "Can I make it with $20k"
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: Must be serious. Must put in the time / effort. 3 hours a day is NOT enough, you have to "show up"
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: eg. 3am, need to babysit trade, must WORK HARD, cannot just tread water
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: Loma started with less than $20k

HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: Might reach the point where you don't need to watch streams, read books, don't need to practice strats..
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: ..but until this point must WORK YOUR ASS OFF
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: Make friens with yourself, your own trading demons, it's not whales, CZ, SBF, Elon that's fucking you, it's you.
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: With $20k, you can for sure reach the point where you never need to worry about money again
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: Eventually, you'll become your own ally, a voice in your head..
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: .."you shouldn't be doing that bro, don't add more, cut the position bro"..
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: ..listen to this voice, go from greedy demon in your head to a friend that helps you..
HOW-TO-MAKE-IT: ..the money will the flow

STRONG-COIN-PA: Strong coins have different PA than weak coins - try and play these strong coins, cost opportunity playing the weaker coins

HOLDING-SR-IS-STRONG: Dropping to an SR and chopping there is strong (can wick below but not close below)
HOLDING-SR-IS-STRONG: Like SZ level reclaim (SZ: "impulse no use to me"), like CBS rsi resetting, like Pierre Stoch resetting
HOLDING-SR-IS-STRONG: "loma-holding-a-SR-level-is-a-sign-of-strength-1.png"

REACTION: It not a "price area" thing, it's a "reaction thing" that we want to see (follow through / continuation)
REACTION: Prices drifts towards the lows and is IMMEDIATELY bought back up - lots of aggressive buyers at this area
REACTION: "loma-interested-in-price-area-AND-correct-reactions-at-that-area.png"

SHARP-MOVES: Always some sort of consolidation between sharp moves up (or down)
SHARP-MOVES: On HTF (D3), might look like up only, but zoom in a bit (H4), will always have some sort of consolidation
SHARP-MOVES: Very few sharp moves don't have any consolidation

MAIN-RULE-OF-TRADING: Make consistantly good decisions, don't overthink going for moonshots, boring and predictable

LOMA-DAILY-ROUTINE: Doesn't care about Asia session, London session, etc in his trading
LOMA-DAILY-ROUTINE: Wake up, have a drink (juice or WARM WATER), scan the market, set alerts
LOMA-DAILY-ROUTINE: If already in a trade, try not to touch it, just fuck off and do something else (run errands etc)
LOMA-DAILY-ROUTINE: The less time you spend staring at a chart the better, staring at a chart IS NOT TRADING
LOMA-DAILY-ROUTINE: You can't make anything happen when staring all the time at an H4 chart

CANDLE-ANALYSIS: uses black and white candles as they don't draw emotions
CANDLE-ANALYSIS: where are they taking place (SR levels)
CANDLE-ANALYSIS: how fast they dump or pump (follow-through, continuation)
CANDLE-ANALYSIS: doesn't use candle patterns per se
CANDLE-ANALYSIS: SFPs are the biggest candle pattern that he will use

OVERNIGHT: will sometimes abandon his "no overnight positions" rule for his journal (eg: nothing happening during the day)

STREAM-WATCHING: don't skip forward when watching streams of analysts, you'll miss lots of nuance, valuable info
STREAM-WATCHING: watching his stream, pause the video before he charts and compare your chart to his (don't be lazy!)
STREAM-WATCHING: learning to trade is not linear..
STREAM-WATCHING: ..watch a hundred hours of video, 70 hours churning, not helping much..
STREAM-WATCHING: ..20 quite useful, 10 very useful and boost your trading
STREAM-WATCHING: In any competitve sport, like trading, any small amount of effort goes a LONG way (like learning from his stream)

BEST-TRADERS-HE-LIKES: Twitter guys that use size: Bitbit, GCR, TraderMayne, Pierre, AltCoinPsycho, All Haven Analysts, Baylisk
BEST-TRADERS-HE-LIKES: Podcast: "Chat With Traders" Mike Bellafiori

DIAGONALS: diagonals are a scam, don't use (or only use sparingly WITH SRs)
DIAGONALS: diagonals are only needed by traders that don't use SRs (horizontals) properly

TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE: patterns (bull flags), indicator (macd, rsi, volume), MAs.. then dedicated himself to PA
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE: once learned price action, indicators and MAs became much more useful
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE: eventually didn't need indicators anymore (after 1000s of trades)
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE: hardest part wasn't the TA, it was mastering his emotions
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE: SR is FUNDAMENTAL! Fundamentals is key. 
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE: market profile, order flow, normal candlesticks, renko can all be used for SR
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE-WHERE-TO-FOCUS: SR is where the market is buying, where the market is selling..
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE-WHERE-TO-FOCUS: ..focus on how many are selling, how strong is the selling, how strong is the buying..
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE-WHERE-TO-FOCUS: ..shouldn't be focused on "OMG, RSI is over 70!".. master these fundamentals
TA-LOMA-USED-BEFORE-WHERE-TO-FOCUS: Make sure you study!

CAPITULATION-ALERTS: very important to mark out vHTF levels you would buy at after terrible news (and set alerts)
CAPITULATION-ALERTS: need to do this so you don't get caught up in the emotional CT turmoil
CAPITULATION-ALERTS: need to have a strategy for this as you'll be too scared to buy
CAPITULATION-ALERTS: mark out some god-tier level where you'll START buying (10% or 15%)

TWITTER-NARRATIVE-ACCOUNTS-TO-FOLLOW: These have good understanding of news events, lots of signal, very little noise
TWITTER-NARRATIVE-ACCOUNTS-TO-FOLLOW: tier10k (db), coindesk, fintech frank, larry cermack, tree of alpha, hsaka, bitbit

TWITTER-NARRATIVE-ACCOUNTS-TO-FOLLOW: "loma-who-to-follow-for-narratives-on-twitter.png"

EXTREME-EMOTIONS: at the extremes of the chart, there are extreme emotions (reflected by extreme wicks)
EXTREME-EMOTIONS: the ones that control their emotions will nearly always win
EXTREME-EMOTIONS: wicks are people fomoing in and out, or being forced in or out, people that can't handle the stress
EXTREME-EMOTIONS: euphoria at the tops and depression at the lows
EXTREME-EMOTIONS: Loma lost 50k/100k cryptotopia and it was all he had in crypto, need mental strength to continue, he was devestated for a week 

TRADING-RISK: part of trading is taking a risk, you have to take a risk 

MAKING-MONEY-GAME-THEORY: only way you make money trading if buying is if more people buy after you
MAKING-MONEY-GAME-THEORY: only way you make money trading if selling is if more people sell after you

FTX-BLOWUP: market makers are gone right now, that is why prices are very volatile right now

CT-CHADS: don't get upset when they lose a heap, they know it's part of the game
CT-CHADS: new traders go beserk on CT when there is real bearish drama, not seasoned
CT-CHADS: practice stoicism to be an awesome trader, control your emotions, TA isn't important, EMOTIONAL CONTROL

RANGES: I always draw my ranges as blocks as having just 1 single number (Fib range) doesn't give robust strategies

EXECUTION-AMOUNT-OF-ENTRIES: Loma, as a whale, will have 6 or 7 entry levels
EXECUTION-AMOUNT-OF-ENTRIES: Normal folk, not insane size, 4 or 5 entries should suffice
EXECUTION-AMOUNT-OF-ENTRIES: "loma-execution-layered-bid-he-will-use-6-or-7-entries.png"

EXECUTION-CLOSE-EARLY: will close a trade if it's too resistant or if it starts to CONSOLIDATE ON LTFs
EXECUTION-CLOSE-EARLY: ie: no follow through
EXECUTION-CLOSE-EARLY: "loma-execution-will-close-if-price-begins-to-consolidate-on-LTF.png"

EXECUTION-HARD-AND-SOFT-SL: sol short trade bit of a "wtf?" but actually explains his execution, 250k position size of 2M account
EXECUTION-HARD-AND-SOFT-SL: soft SL was H1 close above 17 (approx 4% SL)
EXECUTION-HARD-AND-SOFT-SL: hard SL was reclaim of D1 block about 17.8 (approx 10% SL)
EXECUTION-HARD-AND-SOFT-SL: Position size is based on the HARD SL: 1% risk of 2M account is about 200k position size with a 10% SL
EXECUTION-HARD-AND-SOFT-SL: So, position size based on hard SL on HTF but soft SL based on soft SL on LTF

SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: if 80% of the market think one way, you should be questioning it
SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: next time you get the fear feeling to not buy, remember to buy
SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: I'm buying support and CAN DEFINE MY RISK
SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: Build your ablity to execute when THINGS ARE HARD - this is an important ability
SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: Making tough decisions under stress is THE SKILL TO HAVE
BETTER-BUYING-HIGH: better to buy higher above support than lower below resistance
PUBLIC: He'd never publicly share a trade unless he wanted folk to also buy the coin and pump it
PUBLIC: Folk that share trades (CT) are
TOPS: want to see nice clean consolidation at resistance if it's to break
TOPS: this means it's obviously not nuking
TOPS: don't want to see pump, retrace, pump less retrace more, pump even less retrace even more (make LH too) see: "EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM"
TOPS: CBS also said today that increasing volatility is associated with tops forming (EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM)
IMPULSE-CANDLES: Want to see them not get retraced; this is a sign of weakness (ie: their FVG should be support)

TITLE: Loma's Lounge Ep.3: CPI, BTC and PAIN
TA: People think TA is used to predict the market, it's not, it's used to define your risk (9 mins)
TA: Is not really real, it's a mental and technical framework to define risk
ICT: ICT methods work, he's just far too wordy and repackages other concepts, vastly over complicates it. Loma use PA, just more simply.
ICT: Loma hasn't been able to sit through 1 ICT video in full, ICT is a very dull presenter, he makes simple concepts very hard
MARKET-BIAS-INDICATOR: If price takes 2 days to go up, then 1 H4 candle wipes it all out, bears are in charge of markets
PROFITABLE: Took Loma 2 years to make money (42 mins)
PROFITABLE: Didn't happen overnight, was eating shit, ate less shit, became break even, then marginally profitable, then profitable, then the bull market came and he banged!
PROFITABLE: It happened gradually, but to others it looked like he did it overnight.

TITLE: Loma's Lounge Ep.8: IS THIS A BOTTOM OR SCAM?
R-SCAM: 15m30s
R-SCAM: "loma-dont-take-R-seriously.png"
R-SCAM: Doesn't take R seriously, can't pay your bills with "R"
R-SCAM: There are people that don't tweak their setup midway (move SL closer to entry to increase R then post the chart)..
R-SCAM: .. but he's seen many tweak their trades (move SL) and post them, are trying to scam people with this
R-SCAM: You account for your portfolio for how much money you make in percentages, 2x 10x your account
R-SCAM: If you're not tweaking / manipulating the R as the trade progresses, then R is fine
PERSONALITY: you can tell successful traders by their personality
PERSONALITY: they will not get offended easily
PERSONALITY: HighStakesCapita doxxed himself as poker pro, Loma says poker and trading very similar personality needed
LEVEL-RECLAIM: Loma marked H4 SR level, would consider it reclaimed if if 2 H1 candles close above it
LEVEL-RECLAIM: If you were short, then close short on 1st H1 close above the SR, open long on 2nd H1 close above SR
LEVEL-RECLAIM: "a failed short is a good reason to long"
LEVEL-RECLAIM: this is a bit like SZ confirmation (SZ goes into much lower TFthough, break HTF SR, hold abv, LTF MSB again)
OVERNIGHT: Loma will only leave overnight positions if he "can define the risk"
CORRECT-TT: Hard for him to verbalise this thought process on stream, normally done instictively
CORRECT-TT: Loma is statistically wrong 40% of the time - so always making levels (TA) so market can show him when he's wrong
CORRECT-TT: If market were to tell me am an idiot, how would it do it?
CORRECT-TT: If market were to cuff me, how would it do it?
CORRECT-TT: Loma is "risk averse" - how could I be wrong, how am I going to get fucked over..
CORRECT-TT: ..most people are the opposite, they think "how much money am I going to make"..
CORRECT-TT: .. 20% upside, I can 5x my account, I can DOUBLE my account in one trade!
CORRECT-TT: He's assuming he could be wrong, how would market verify he is in fact wrong (TraderTom style)
SYSTEM: Loma started in bull market, easy, just used RSI (OB/OS/div) easy money
SYSTEM: See what's giving you 80% of your results and just double down in that
SYSTEM: Loma is good trader in all conditions except for "range-bound"; he steps away in the chop
SYSTEM: Will take a trade based on invalidation (like SZ), 2% SL, BNB, whole account position size

TITLE: Loma's Lounge Ep.14: ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN?
OB: 2m30s into the video
OB: Loma doesn't use traditional / original sense of OBs
OB: Look where significant PA has occurred (SR)
OB: So his OBs are really just SRs
LOMA-REVERSE-OBs: MQ: He tends to mark some SRs as OBs, but in reverse..
LOMA-REVERSE-OBs: MQ: demand: the first up candle after impulse down
LOMA-REVERSE-OBs: MQ: supply: the first down candle after impulse up
BTC-CHART: Need to know what BTC doing (bullish / bearish) for alt coin bias
BTC-CHART: BTC very tricky to trade, easier to trade alts (BTC trade only once every 10/15 trades in his journal)
RANGE: doesn't like when prices fall back into a range and close there
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: hard and soft stops
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: soft stops are tighter (used when awake)
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: hard SLs are wide, give low R trades (safety net incase sleeping)
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: "loma-eth-fomc-trade-plan-loma-execution3-current-trade-execution.png"
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: Give it a couple of candle closes to establish a low / base (SZ style execution of Loma: "wait - this is where you fuck up")..
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: .. we can't trade impulses, we can only trade level to level (reclaim-hold-expandAwayMSB - bullish MS on LTF)
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: "loma-support-trade-trigger-doge-wait-like-sz-give-it-a-couple-of-candle-closes.png"
EXECUTION-WHEN-IN-HTF-SUPPORT: You don't want to hail mary support (D1), we don't know if it'll hold or die (not full portfolio knife catching)
EXECUTION-WHEN-IN-HTF-SUPPORT: take a small starter position at D1 support, add on confirmation of reclaim of H4 level higher
EXECUTION-WHEN-IN-HTF-SUPPORT: "loma-execution-when-in-HTF-support.png"
TRADING-BASED-ON-FA: Should be swings, not scalps
BINANCE-LISTING: coins that get listed on binance tend do all do well initially
HIS-JOURNAL-IS-A-DEGEN-ACCOUNT: He's take 3%, 4%, 5% risk on each trade in journal..
HIS-JOURNAL-IS-A-DEGEN-ACCOUNT: ..often multiple trades at a time, even though market kind of sucks right now
HIS-JOURNAL-IS-A-DEGEN-ACCOUNT: he doesn't take this much risk on his larger account (because he can't)
HIS-JOURNAL-IS-A-DEGEN-ACCOUNT: sensible traders will take 1% or 2% risk max per trade
LONG-TERM-BAG: Means hodl for about 3 months
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: PvP, take money from other pepole, need to give false narratives
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: need people to believe things that just ain't so, so they part with their money
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: imagine it's just loma v. composite man, composite man tries to sell him narratives...
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: ..confuse him, trick him, rush him, make him greedy (too big position)
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: smoke & mirrors, designed to give you too much and too little information..
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: ..designed for you to lose mony, transfer of wealth from people who understand the game..
NATURE-OF-THE-TRADING-GAME: .. to people who don't understand the game (dumb money and smart money)
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: started with 2k, lost it all, then put in $500 every pay check, considered it like a video game..
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: or paying for an education.. people like to jump into the deep end (big postion sizes)
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: .. you need to EARN the right to trade big position sizes, need to be able to make money with..
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..spot before getting bigger position sizes and using leverage.. FOCUS ON THE PROCESS..
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..need to be consistant, disciplined, need to show up every day
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..took Loma 2 years to make his first million
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: He made his first million in a bear market
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..took him 1.5 years to be mentally ready for trading, that he understood trading, or what he needed to do to make it
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..it happens very quickly when you "get it"
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..big thing for him was getting wiped out on leverage, put 10k in, tried to trade it, kept getting wiped out
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..when he understood what his weakenesses were, used strategies to mitigate them, 
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..his strategy now is to mitigate the dumb shit he could possibly do
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..first step of trading is realising YOU ARE YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..so how would you go about BEATING YOURSELF in the market
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..loma would beat himself by leveraging too hard, entering too early, too large a size, mabe fomo..
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..taking sub-optimal trades (just to be in a trade), not focusing on the correct narratives..
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..things like this fucked him a lot, so created strategies to not do these
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: .. no overnight trades, max risk 2% or 3%, only trade the top 10 in volume..
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: ..only trade the top 15 in MOVERS (based on percentage moves)
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: internal controls for trading, self-regulation, works very well for loma
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: He kept a journal to realise all these mistakes that he had to rectify. MUST JOURNAL
LOMA-STARTING-CAPITAL: Loma lost everything in 2018/2019

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.17: GEMINI, GATE, BYBIT, HUOBI? 221116
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJn9oUd8fio&t=224s 
EXCHANGES: Bybit is a little worrisome
THREE-TAP: 3-tap, kinda a triple drive, but not really
THREE-TAP: 1st low sets low
THREE-TAP: 2nd low is HL
THREE-TAP: 3rd low is HL
THREE-TAP: is based on HLs
THREE-TAP: higher buying interest all the time yet still in range, hasn't expanded yet
THREE-TAP: sign that people happy to buy at these prices and accumulate
THREE-TAP: Loma uses 3-tap idea
TRIPLE-DRIVE: LL, LL, LL (in a channel), buy when breaks out of channel
TRIPLE-DRIVE: Loma doesn't really use this typical triple-drive idea
SUPPORT-STRENGTH: 23m30s into stream, visual representation of what want to see at support
SUPPORT-STRENGTH: at support, we like to see prices immediately bought back up
SUPPORT-STRENGTH: do NOT want to see prices hovering at support
SUPPORT-STRENGTH: "loma-support-strength-buyup-with-follow-through-want-to-see-this.png"
SUPPORT-STRENGTH: But note from "EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT:" Loma said "give it a couple of candle closes to establish a base" (SZ style)..
SUPPORT-STRENGTH: .. we can't trade impulses, we can only trade level to level (reclaim-hold-expandAwayMSB - bullish MS on LTF)
BLIND-BID: never blind-bid (knife-catch) with entire portfolio
BYBIT-OFFER: after FTX, bybit $30k to influencer accounts that deposit very large amounts
BYBIT-OFFER: $250k deposit for $30k trading bonus
BYBIT-OFFER: user typed that it's a standard bonus for everyone, not just Loma
BYBIT-OFFER: not everyone will hit the trading volume to get the bonus
BYBIT-OFFER: 150M trading volume in 30days needed to get the $30k
BYBIT-OFFER: so it's like a free lone to bybit, very few people can do this
BYBIT-OFFER: especially in current PA conditions, would need about 100 trades using full account (massive scalping)
BYBIT-OFFER: Loma thought it was a little suss they DM'd 
BYBIT-OFFER: Loma hasn't even traded 150M total volume over the last few weeks, and he's heard that liquidity for alts is poor on Bybit (OK for majors)
BINANCE-RECOVERY-FUND: buy every coin that is in CZ's recovery fund
BULK: trading is about catching the bulk of the move, NOT every single percentage point

===== https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFYQjDYHDcM
TITLE: Loma's Lounge Ep.18: NEW EPISODE, SAME PRICE
BUYING-THE-2021-LOWS: the "double bubble"
BUYING-THE-2021-LOWS: he bought quite a lot of spot alts at the 2021 lows, but didn't hold long enough..
BUYING-THE-2021-LOWS: ..he'd have made 70M on these alone if he held longer (they all did multiples)..
BUYING-THE-2021-LOWS: ..he bought 7 figs of each coin, but the number started getting big for him so he sold
BUYING-THE-2021-LOWS: something he wants to rectify, buy a little of each coin so he can hold for longer
BUYING-THE-2021-LOWS: bought 20% of spot for 221115, 10% btc and 10% eth spot right now, would like to work this to about 35/65 btc/eth

EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: Loma, SZ and JB all have very similar triggers / execution
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: all HTF direction based on SR then LTF confirmation of HTF direction (follow-through) 
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: Loma follow-through: HTF SR impulse above, want to see SR hold and then FOLLOW-THROUGH to the upside (continuation)
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: SZ break: impulse above HTF horizontal, consolidate (range) abv the level, break (MSB) above the consolidation
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: JB reaction: sweep low into HTF OB+ then LTF BoS to upside (FVG starter entry), watches for REACTION to add to position
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: "loma-sz-jb-execution-level-reclaim-failing-PA-size-off-and-get-out-1.png"
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB-MB: Martyn is also using HTF PoIs (OBs), liq grabs and LTF BoS for entry trigger now just like JB  
EXECUTION-LOMA-BIG-CANDLE-DOWN: how to "knife-catch" 32m30s into stream..
EXECUTION-LOMA-BIG-CANDLE-DOWN: buying big candle down is ok, but not sophisticated enough..
EXECUTION-LOMA-BIG-CANDLE-DOWN: want to buy big candle down into support and then see LTF strength (prices popping back up)
DEX: after FTX blow-up, now is the time for dexes (self custody) and metaverse (buy art, trade weird assets)
DEX: no bad actors on DEX (like SBF at FTX)

VOLATILITY: As price falls, volatility increases
VOLATILITY: As price rises, volatility decreases (takes more to move the market)
VOLATILITY: This is what a lot of people don't understand
VOLATILITY: When btc at 3k, it was moving 15/20% up and down within an hour

DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN: deviation above level with "devil horns" (sell wicks) 
DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN: just trolling with devil horns - it's a psuedo double top (but with smaller gap inbetween)
DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN: "loma-devil-horn-pattern1.png"
DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN-DOUBLE-TOP: normally want to wait for twice the duration of the pump, if the pump took 5 days..
DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN-DOUBLE-TOP: ..want consolidation of 7-10 days.. then 2nd pump
DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN: for devil horns, if pump took 5 days, consolidation shorter before 2nd pump (about 5 days)
DEVIL-HORN-PATTERN: "loma-devil-horn-pattern4-double-top-devil-horns-difference.png"

VIP-MAX: Loma has VIP max on Binance (so he likes BNB coin!)

LISTING-PRICES-NEW-COINS: when a new coin trades below its listing value, usually a good buy, founders will buy it

GCR: GCR said, market is awful, if you've been putting in the work for the last year, you'll be reqarded for it in the future. Don't give up

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.18: WHERE IS THE BID https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeidgIPedcY
BUILDING-FOLIO: no leverage, but all-in every trade (spot)
BUILDING-FOLIO: market in, market out, bad
BUILDING-FOLIO: when leverage started, he'd 3x or 4x all-in all the time
BUILDING-FOLIO: trading is a sport or a game, start at level 1, side quests, need to get experience in order to play the game well
EDGE: always want to trade on the edge
EDGE: best long is a failed short, best short is a failed long
EDGE: trade should get invalidate quickly to minimise risk and you can get out
BOTTOMS: when coins start to pump and find bottoms, it's not because of more buyers, it's because the sellers are gone
BOTTOMS: if the sellers are gone, then it should be able to flip SR levels bullishly
BOTTOMS: "loma-SR-strength-and-weakenss"
ECHO-BUBBLE: a large significant bounce but it doesn't reach previous ATH (echos get weaker and weaker)

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.19: BLACK FRIDAY SALE ON CRYPTO? OR DARKER DAYS TO COME? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l0EqqgHb5g
MEAT-OF-THE-MOVE: most of your money comes from the meat of the move, not catching knifes / bottoms
MEAT-OF-THE-MOVE: "loma-consolidation-reclaim-number-of-candles-about-20.png"
MEAT-OF-THE-MOVE: "HOLDING-SR-IS-STRONG:"
REVERSAL-BOTTOMS: downtrend then bottom, don't try and knfie catch the pico bottom
REVERSAL-BOTTOMS: bottom will be choppy and scammy, best entry is NOT the bottom, but higher up when breaking out of bottom range
REVERSAL-BOTTOMS: nearly always the best bet to take the first retest after strength on medium to high timeframe - best risk adjusted bet
REVERSAL-BOTTOMS: the only way you don't make money following a trend is if you get in at the end of the trend 
REVERSAL-BOTTOMS: "loma-trend-reversal-PA-4.png"
SL-PLACEMENT: at the structural low before the move up
SL-PLACEMENT: "loma-SL-placed-at-structural-low-before-the-move-up.png"
RULES: make consistently good decisions
FOSSIL-PUMPS-UNCORRELATED: ltc, xrp, qtum, xmr, stellar
FOSSIL-PUMPS-UNCORRELATED: usually a very bad sign when these pump alone
RECLAIM-To-TREND: better to buy reclaims, possible start of new trends
LOMA-RANGES: mark out highs and lows aprroximately, should be a SR at the 50% too
LOMA-RANGES: he doesn't use Fib tool with EQ at 0.5, he uses SR boxes to give himself more leeway
LOMA-SCANNING: biggest movers, usually biggest movers on D1 or D3 time-frames
LOMA-SCANNING: largest weekly mover doesn't really use, should be able to tell it from largest D1/D3 movers
LOMA-SCANNING: if trading intra-day, look at H1 and H4
LOMA-SCANNING: this shows what people are willing to put their money into
LOMA-SCANNING: but always, always, always look at narrative for biggest mover
LOMA-SCANNING: if no narrative, it's random occurance (fat finger, PnD group)
LOMA-SCANNING: you DON'T have to agree with the narrative, loma often doesn't
LOMA-SCANNING: your feelings don't matter, your gut feeling counts though, need to develop gut feeling
HAVEN: goal isn't for you guys to stay in the haven, goal is for you guys to improve and be self sufficient
HAVEN: learn what you can, pick up some skills, then get the fuck out
HAVEN: loma wants us guys to be very independent and need to pay for any services
HAVEN: all loma wants is in the future "how is XXX such a great trader"... it's coz he was in the haven for a while..
HAVEN: ..this is the only marketing that loma wants to do

===== https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s7nm8j63gs Loma's Lounge Ep.20: POWELL SCAM PUMP STRIKES AGAIN?
FOMC: Pumps during FOMC, Fed Chairman Speech or CPI nearly always get faded
RECLAIMS: use closes for SR level reclaims, wicks are not the best for reclaims
RECLAIMS: he's had more success using closes than wicks for SR level reclaims
RECLAIMS: "loma-use-candle-closes-for-SR-levels-to-be-RECLAIMED.png"
SR-PoB: Should always use the PoB (point of breakdown / breakout) for the SR
SR-PoB: "loma-bad-analysis-should-ALWAYS-use-the-PoB-1.png"
FOLLOW: @beetcoin very good and very pateient trader..
FOLLOW: ..big size, can see loma style SR he uses and he waits for them to play out
BULL-MARKET: don't need 3 months of bull market, just need 2 weeks of bull with shitcoin
BULL-MARKET: but need to stay up late and wake up early, make very good money

===== https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg1QAJHgR9w Loma's Lounge Ep.21: BUY OR BYE? 221202
RECLAIMS: reclaim an SR, want to see it break above, retest with price IMMEDIATELY catching a bid
RECLAIMS: "loma-not-what-we-want-to-see-for-a-reclaim.png"
RECLAIMS: reclaims are a sign of strength, presumably at accumulation areas, want to see this
RECLAIMS: not missing much of a move up waiting for a reclaim of SR but taking on a lot of risk
RECLAIMS: prices don't just accumulate and pump overnight, well shouldn't, if pump is to be longer lasting
RECLAIMS: not as cool to be a reclaim trader, but it is a much more robust strategy
RECLAIMS: LOMA IS A RECLAIM TRADER (sz is a reclaim trader, MA trend traders are reclaim traders)
RECLAIMS: greatest trick devil ever played on traders is making them think they can catch bottoms
EXECUTION-TWAP: ***************************************************************************************************
EXECUTION-TWAP: Time Weighted Average Price
EXECUTION-TWAP: with reclaim of SR, just buy every hour that the SR reclaim holds (this is TWAP)
EXECUTION-TWAP: "loma-H1-long-locations-including-reclaim-of-PoB-level-twap.png"
EXECUTION-TWAP: ***************************************************************************************************
TPs: use closes, not wicks, prices tend to hit the closes more than they do the wicks
PATTERNS: patterns such as triangles, H&S, bull-flags are just the result of understanding PA
PATTERNS: loma likes using PA, not patterns, but all roads lead to rome, use which ever brings you the best results
CHARTS: loma mostly uses the D1, H4 and H1 charts. D1 and H4 for PA/SRs, but actually trades using H1 chart (entries)
CHARTS: he doesn't like to be in positions for a long period of time
CHARTS: If you have a job, can't sit and stare at charts, then you probably best to use the D1 for entries etc 
BEST-TIMES: NYO (early in morning for Loma)
BEST-TIMES: Asia open (late at night for Loma)
BEST-TIMES: Quietest during the middle of the day for Loma (west coast USA) 
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: 28m into video Mana analysis.. TT style compound on STRENGTH execution
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: (1.0) does it look good (using loma market structure (SR / PoB / dying momentum))
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: (2.0) next, what do I want to see and what do I not want to see (starter position and where to compound)
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: (3.0) must understand his perspective and the other person's perspective (he's long and their short)..
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: (3.1) ..what is it they want to see, you have to understand your counterparty, WHERE WOULD I BE WRONG..
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: (3.2) ..helps set SL, as what they want to see happen is where I need to move aside
TRADE-THOUGHT-PROCESS: (3.3) .. as you start to see things forming against you, get out
RESISTANCE: strong pump at resistance usually on back of some news as most don't buy at resistance
TREND-START: get retests at the start of trends
TREND-START: once bull market starts, won't get retests and it'll be too late
BEAR-MARKET-19-22: current bear market 2022 much harder than last bear market 2019
BEAR-MARKET-19-22: 2019 would have significant rallies in the bear lasting week+
BEAR-MARKET-19-22: 2019 quite a few alts would pump decently too
BEAR-MARKET-19-22: 2022 no real significant rallies
BEAR-MARKET-19-22: 2022 coins that are pumping have no liquidity at all
BEAR-MARKET-19-22: "loma-bear-market-comparison-1-2019-bearish-retest-plenty-of-pumps.png"
PAIR-TRADING: compare dot and atom.. dotusdt/atomusdt (forward slash)
NEXT-NARRATIVE: DEXs are the next narrative
NEXT-NARRATIVE: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-exchange
NEXT-NARRATIVE: loma has just done a write up on DEXs, "loma-dex-dApp-write-up-3.txt"
NEXT-NARRATIVE: he's lazy, wouldn't do this unless he really believes it's the next narrative
NEXT-NARRATIVE: still not great HTF, but LTF, showing good relative strength compared to rest of market (eg: uni > btc)
NEXT-NARRATIVE: loma likes UNI (because he likes the uniswap dex) - the "binance" of dexs hasn't been established yet
NEXT-NARRATIVE: uniswap first decent dex for spot trading
ON-CHAIN-TOOLS: loma asked "do you use any on-chain tools like hyblock" - yes, I do, laevitas also good

===== https://youtu.be/lZNyMitf1Dk LOMAS_LOUNGE_s02-e22-POST-FOMC-NUKE
BOTTOMING-STRUCTURE: Like SZ, can't deal with V-reversal... bottoming structure must form a bit of a range
BOTTOMING-STRUCTURE: "loma-what-a-bottoming-structure-looks-like-just-like-SZ.png"
SOPHISTICATED-COINS: Low time-frame BTC and ETH have much more sophisticated traders, Loma doesn't really like trading them..
SOPHISTICATED-COINS: .. where you think think you should place a SL you should actually bid there - severe gamesmanship on LTF btc and eth
SOPHISTICATED-COINS: coins like SOL are "cleaner" on LTF, SR respected more
BINANCE-JOURNAL-ACCT: Loma removed all money from his personal account on binance ($30M dollars), just keeping his journal account
BINANCE-JOURNAL-ACCT: Loma is going to try and get his journal account "The Haven Account" into the top 10 of Binance leaderboard
BINANCE-JOURNAL-ACCT: GCR is on the leaderboard right now and Loma is going to hunt him
BINANCE-JOURNAL-ACCT: He'll share the journal at the start of each month only (otherwise why would people join the haven? UB & CBS furious)
BINANCE-JOURNAL-ACCT: Since he's removed his personal money the journal will be his main journal

===== 221221 Loma's Lounge Ep.23: XMAS SPECIAL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obSQDfcc3YU
VOLUME: look at BTC and ETH on coinmarketcap and check their 30-day volume
VOLUME: binance futures used to have 500M daily volume, now 200M daily volume (holidays, FTX collapse)
MS: MS is defined by the TREND
MS: if trend is down then MS is down
STAKING: announcement of staking is nearly always bearish (ape)..
STAKING: ..folk think staking, people buy, hold / stake, price up only, supply locked up..
STAKING: ..but markets never this simple, nearly always priced in already
SUPPORT: a good support is ABOVE an area that is being contested
SUPPORT: people want to buy ABOVE the sticking point therefore acts as support
SUPPORT: if resistance is $100, wants to see it break above $100 then trade at 103, 104..
SUPPORT: ..does NOT want to see it trade at 100, 98, 100, 97 etc
SUPPORT: "loma-looks-like-underside-retest-good-and-bad-support.png"
TA: is your way of "understanding" the market
TA: is only to define your RR (SL, reward, risk)
TA: must look at REACTIONS at certain levels
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: highest hitrate trade in recent times (52min)
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: "loma-distrubution-pattern-LEVER-example6-played-out-dying-momentum.png"
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: such an easy short because I know right away when I'm wrong
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: this is THE very definition of distribution
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: buying starts to slow and momemntum slows down
TA: buying is green candle, selling is red candle, buying and selling is real
TA: some buying then lots of selling (upside wick, selling wick)
TA: some selling then lots of buying (downside wick, buying wick)
TA: TA is real because candles are real, TA is the aggregation of buying and selling
CRAP-PA: Loma's not really trading much right now because bad PA and less participants and he's already made it
CRAP-PA: but if he hadn't made it, he would for sure be trading as need to put in the screen time and (semi) succeed in difficult conditions
CRAP-PA: he's also relatively young so would get bored retired, still in the game as he needs something to do
SCANNING: sorts by percentage change then scans through there
SCANNING: looking at HNT, it has pumped 32%, looks to see when the next funding cycle is (it's in 1h42m)
SCANNING: checks the volume (using the vol tool, volume bars at the bottom)
SCANNING: check the narrative to see if there's a reason for the big pump
SCANNING: If trading funding, need to use lower timeframes (changes every 8 hours)
PIERRE: will write you a novel to say don't trade right now, go have a beer and spend time with your family
PIERRE: he's amazing, he's good, what could be said in 5 sentences, he'll use 5 paragraphs, but he's loveable
PIERRE: he tries to break everything down in the most super simple noob friendly way
CRAZY-COMMUNITIES: token with crazy community, don't care about TA, but in it for the shits and giggles
CRAZY-COMMUNITIES: axs, gmt, previously sol (like nfts, liked the ecosystem, the games on it)

SMALLER-ACCTS-FOCUS-ON-ALTS: Q: "Loma, why do you say smaller accounts should focus on alts if I can get a couple of R per week trading majors?"
SMALLER-ACCTS-FOCUS-ON-ALTS: if trading btc or eth, need to size up, bigger size affects you mentally
SMALLER-ACCTS-FOCUS-ON-ALTS: more sophistacted traders trade btc and eth (they can't get huge size on illiquid alts)
SMALLER-ACCTS-FOCUS-ON-ALTS: Alts tend to have a narrative and tend to be predictable based on PA
BTC-NEWER-TRADERS: Should only use H4 and above as PA more tricky / sophisticated / competative
BTC-NEWER-TRADERS: Even Loma doesn't really trade m15 on majors, better casino tables to play to take other people's money 
STRONG-COIN: when prices are going to trend hard, don't tend to get nice retests for entry, forced to kind of fomo in
STRONG-COIN: "loma-trending-coin-few-good-retests-sol.png"
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Bullish case is just the reverse
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: "loma-dont-short-pumps-without-bearish-structure-forming-6-bullish-triple-drive-dying-momentum.png"
FUNDS: Funds / whales don't market buy, they have more sophisticated buying models, it's very rarely "up only"
EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE: full retrace is not stength (OBs will tend to be full retraces to their origin)
EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE: want to see it break out of a resistance (level1) then pump to an old support (level2)
EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE: the retrace should be to level2 (strong), not level1 (weak)
EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE: "loma-full-retrace-OB-issue-1.png"
EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE: EXECUTION-RETEST-SR-MARKING-NO-FULL-RETRACE: 
TRUST-YOUR-FEELINGS: many of the best traders he knows just use a simple chart
TRUST-YOUR-FEELINGS: they've been trading so long, can just pull out their phone and say "looks heavy" or "looks strong"
TRUST-YOUR-FEELINGS: they can just look at the PA and get an accurate bias, so their hitrate is good
LEADERBOARD-BINANCE: goal is to get into the top 10 (at least). probably not too hard
LEADERBOARD-BINANCE: really wants to get into the top 3 ($20M area)
CT-NARRATIVES: can get in very early if you follow the right people (outspoken, will definitely shill their bags)
CT-NARRATIVES: they may not always be right, but they will die with their bags, always commenting, always tweeting
CT-NARRATIVES: he always follows these people, might be wrong, but easy trade, they shill coin, if it doesn't move, coin is fucked, easy short
CT-NARRATIVES: if Degen-Spartan shills a coin and doesn't move, then all his buying has been met with equal selling
CT-NARRATIVES: if it does indeed go up, Loma will just sit in it

EXECUTION: as a trader, you need to know when to cut a trade before it hits your SL.
EXECUTION: The market will tend to tip its hand on LTF (if organic move, not if its a pump and dump)
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: pump above SR, dip below SR, reclaim SR - one of his favorite setups
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: easy to trade, happens often, plays out well often
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: You could call it the UB-over-under, UB-retest, the power of 3 (consolidate, manipulation (deviation) expansion).. 
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: ..call it whatever you like, the same stuff just gets repackaged all the time 
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: "loma-execution-favourite-setup-pump-abv-sr-dip-below-sr-reclaim-sr-PDR-1.png"
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: shared trade success example: "loma-pump-dip-reclaim-example-sol-1.png"

EXECUTION-RETEST-SR-MARKING-NO-FULL-RETRACE: for bullish retests, he likes to use the lows as the retest areas (ie: reclaim old lows)
EXECUTION-RETEST-SR-MARKING-NO-FULL-RETRACE: for bearish retests, he likes to use the highs as the retest areas (ie: reclaim old highs)

EXECUTION-RETEST-SR-MARKING-NO-FULL-RETRACE: EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE:
TRX-JUSTIN-SUN: founder of announcement of an announcment, then when announcing, there's more to come!
EXECUTION-SZ-LEVEL-RECLAIM-ABSORBTION: spending consolidating at SR gives time for absorbtion
EXECUTION-SZ-LEVEL-RECLAIM-ABSORBTION: "loma-sr-reclaim-break-hold-msb-SZ-gives-time-to-absorb-buying.png"
NARRATIVE: narrative is king in an illiquid market
SFP: the most significant high should be used to declare an SFP (not taking a close-by (local) high)
SFP: most significant highs should be used for marking SFPs on H4 and D1 charts
SFP: SFP of local highs ok for H1 trading
SFP: "loma-most-significant-high-for-SFP.png"
UB-BURN: look at this coin, scary PA, limited returns, right up UB's ally


===== Loma's Lounge Ep.3: THE PULLBACK SPECIAL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUdbvlxyscE
WAIT-FOR-RECLAIM: waiting for a reclaim of SR is like paying a 1% or 2% insurance fee
V-REVERSALS: not good... folk want to see constant small gains (constant strength) to get comfy and for crypto to boom again
V-REVERSALS: V-reversals don't give this comfy feeling
RANGES: Prefers to draw his blue boxes rather than range Fibs
EXHAUSTION: print a new high on D1 (but a sweep) then the day after fail to trade above it is exhaustion
SCENARIOS: should always have two scenarios for a trade (small pullback or level reclaim), might be wrong, but SHOULDN'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN
SCENARIOS: "loma-plan-for-different-scenarios.png"
PUMPING-COINS: market leaders will pump first and the most.. others will follow from folk who missed the market leader pump but won't pump as much
DIIFERENT-WAYS-TO-MAKE-MONEY: don't lose so much by fomo, wait for confirmation / consolidation / reclaim, reducing big losses increases PnL ("best loser wins")
EXECUTIO-SR-BOXES: Q: "loma i see you draw your boxes on the daily.If you see the pullback/reclaim on what timeframe do you wanna see a pullback/reclaim hold the box?"
EXECUTIO-SR-BOXES: A: "great question: you want lower-time-frames to start to flip - LTFs will work their way into HTFs"
EXECUTIO-SR-BOXES: A: "start with H1, looks like pullback coming, look at H4, perhaps H1 pullback is H4 consolidation, D1 level holding"
PIERRE: he's a very good educator / teacher
JIM: Loma doesn't really use order-flow, knows the terminologies, but not the TA
DOGE-SHIB: doesn't like these coins, but prefers shib over doge, better returns

===== TRADE EXECUTION SNIPPETS
TRADE-EXECUTION: Blacksphere fixed risked dynamic position sizing
EXECUTION-BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: 1R trades, playing bounces not reversals
EXECUTION-AMOUNT-OF-ENTRIES: whales 6 or 7, normie 4 or 5
EXECUTION-CLOSE-EARLY: no FOLLOW THROUGH through (too resistant, consolidte on LTF)
EXECUTION-HARD-AND-SOFT-SL: H1 soft SL about 4% away, D1 hard SL about 10% away (size for hard)
EXECUTION-AT-SUPPORT: like SZ, give it a couple of candle closes
EXECUTION-WHEN-IN-HTF-SUPPORT: Don't knife catch, starter position D1 OB, add on H4 level reclaim higher
EXECUTION-LOMA-SZ-JB: Loma, SZ and JB all have very similar triggers / execution
EXECUTION-TWAP: with reclaim of SR, just buy every hour that the SR reclaim holds (this is TWAP)
EXECUTION-OB-FULL-RETRACE-ISSUE: full retrace is not stength (OBs will tend to be full retraces to their origin)
DEVIL-HORNS pump 5 days, sweep 5 days later
DOUBLE-TOP pump 5 days, sweep 7-10 days later
EXEXUTION-FAV-SETUP-PUMP-DIP-RECLAIM: pump above SR, dip below SR, reclaim SR - one of his favorite setups
EXECUTION-RETEST-SR-MARKING-NO-FULL-RETRACE: for bullish retests, he likes to use the lows as the retest areas (ie: reclaim old lows)
EXECUTION-TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Pumps get smaller and retraces gets deeper
