Loma — 27/04/2021
REALITY-CHECK: @everyone really quick a reality check before I drive to my cabin for the week:

REALITY-CHECK: Have patience.

REALITY-CHECK: We will have more and more of these 20-40% pullbacks on ALTs on the way up. It WILL happen. Your goal isn't to be an overnight financial success. The likelihoods of that are extremely thin.

REALITY-CHECK: What you're looking to do is this: 
- Compound gains consistently
- Don't lose money on those 20-40% pullbacks
- Make more money on the recovery

REALITY-CHECK: Don't get sucked into the poor man's situation. It's ironic because people want to be rich so they take on more risk which only keeps them poor.

REALITY-CHECK: Break free of that mentality. I know it's not very intuitive but you have to understand that risking more, betting big and other forms of improper management is how you actually stay broke in a bull market.
This is how you win.

REALITY-CHECK: You stack boring 5-10-15% bangers consistently and don't lose 50% of your portfolio when the market turns against you.
You take a small crack on the chin, maybe a 5-10% loss and then move forward.
There's NOTHING admirable about making 1m and then losing 900k on the dump.
I'd rather make 250k and lose 20k.
1. Less stressful
2. Proper risk management keeps you alive should the dump actually be the top.
You don't want to be one of those people that make millions in a bull market, have like 10x leverage and see it omega dump 30% only to liquidate your portfolio.
Think of it like boxing or MMA, you can have insane offensive capabilities but without defense, you're going to get exploited sooner or later.

The Market of Madness - Endless Range (with CBS)

D1: Large wicks are where liquidations have occurred (perhaps cascade liquidations)

EXEC-EXPERT: He always uses a hard stop
EXEC-EXPERT: Even if it's a huge SL for black swan protection, not really for trading
EXEC-EXPERT: Krill says Loma is an execution expert
EXEC-EXPERT: Chat said he has both discretionary and hard SLs, he rarely takes full 1R loss on a trade (cuts, adds, cuts, adds, adds, etc)
TRADES: He mostly plays SR flips
HTF-LEVELS: He uses Weekly & D3 to determine his bias to trade lower time-frames
PSYCH: CBS & Loma said hardest thing to do is get back in after being stopped out (instead of reversing bias)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: loma-slope-gradient-momentum.png
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling medium slope
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling steep slope (puts in bottom)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling tiny slope (rounded bottom)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Momentum rounded out

=====*****
RANGE-PATTERNS: In a range bound environment; cheesy patterns tend to work (eg: channel)

Support and Resistance Workshop by "The Haven"
TA: SR = supply/demand = OBs = FTA = buy/sell walls
TA: Different names for the same concepts
TA: Loma uses swing high/lows SHSL
TA: Swing low: mark the low of the candle that gets swept
TA: Swing low: the sweep candle should go into an important area 
TA: What is support... just look at the chart (lies, choppy)
LIES: the chart / numbers do not lie
LIES: naratives lie, people lie, govs lie, 
LIES: lot harder to manipulate action than it is narratives
SLBE = Stop Loss to Break Even
CHOPPY-AREA: Choppy area = cluster
CHOPPY-AREA: Choppy areas = lot buying and selling & market participants
CHOPPY-AREA: up from chop = support
CHOPPY-AREA: down from chop = resistance
CHOPPY-AREA: support/demand, if price comes back, initial...
CHOPPY-AREA: ..buyers have TPd on way up & SLBE...
CHOPPY-AREA: ..don't bid the top of the demand zone
CHOPPY-AREA: DON'T BID THE TOP OF SUPPORT
CHOPPY-AREA: ..there will be wicks down to take the SLBEs
CHOPPY-AREA: ..will have been many buyers IN the choppy area
CHOPPY-AREA: ..demand is always a range...
CHOPPY-AREA: Martyn marks demand zone using Fib / OTE range
CHOPPY-AREA: bid 5%, 5%, 5%, 5%, down to 30% @ bottom
CHOPPY-AREA: SLBE at demand top TRIGGERS selling wick down
CHOPPY-AREA: psycology of people SLBE (profits have disappeared)
CHOPPY-AREA: someone is acting out of necessity and we just took their liquidity, we act on their demise, us and the exchange should be taking their money as they're liquidated, it's a zero sum game
CHOPPY-AREA: the more normal higher liquidity coins has more new traders who SLBE
CHOPPY-AREA: want to areas with lots of market participants (perhaps VOLUME (on HTF on liquid coins))
CHOPPY-AREA: downwards / upwards / sideways chop
LOMA-ZONE: marking the bottom of the choppy area!
LOMA-ZONE: Krill: "Loma nails his entries"
LOMA-ZONE: Loma's zones will be choppy
LOMA-ZONE: Lots of red candles in a chop, buy quick retest of this zone
ACTIVE-MPs: Active market participants
ACTIVE-MPs: This is where we want to buy
ACTIVE-MPs: The older the levels, the less they matter (participants will have TPd already)
ACTIVE-MPs: Lots of green candles in a row will have active participants TPing on the way up, moving their stops
ACTIVE-MPs: Look at recent levels, not "my 1.618 Fib"
RESISTANCE: Resistance in bull market is different to resistance in a bear market (not many participants)
Res: Support is a lot more common in a bull market (lots of touches of support)
RESISTANCE: Will usually have a big wick through the swing high resulting in Loma's SHSL resistance zone (wicks above but closes below; people (buyers) will be trapped here)
RESISTANCE: If price starts trading (opening and closing) above this SHSL resistance, then expect it to pump if bull market
RESISTANCE: He marks the wick tops at swing highs for resistance
RESISTANCE: When price travels to the highs but fails to close above, this is resistance
RESISTANCE: Trapped BO traders "please just let the price come back to near my entry and I will get out!"
RESISTANCE: You don't always need an OB, months/weeks of partcipants to tell the range
RESISTANCE: look for follow-through and go with that trend
RESISTANCE: You HAVE to be taking profits on the way up or you're just NGMI as a trader
RESISTANCE: resistance in bull market is normally formed by (i) people shorting (not so much this) (ii) people who bought then got trapped (much more this)
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: when drawing SR, keep in back of mind why it's there and build your own narative (eth 2.0 out, btc ATH pulled eth up, visa news, elon tweet tesla) - helps you understand the market
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Fundamentals drive techs in a bull market
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Put a narrative to things as it is reflected in the technicals
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Fold get in on FA news (tesla accepting btc) and this will create a TA level
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: He won't trade the charts on Uniswap as it's too easily manipulated due to low liquidity, no narrative
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: could be as simple as prior ATH
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: most of the money you make is going to come from average traders, you're not taking money from CZ, Sam, Bezos, Gates. etc
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Natural human reaction, hate losing, so move SLBE
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: He mostly bids the mid to low part of the choppy range
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Put yourself into the shoes of a new, average or intermediate trader and ask "what are they feeling right now?", ecstasy, fear? What's the counterparty feeling?

https://www.twitch.tv/lomacrypto
HISTORY: He's been in crypto since 2015 (a little) and a lot since 2017 (in college)
BULL: What will fcuk you up in a bull market is the volatility
BULL: Fade your euphoria
BULL: He's had friends "make it" within a few months; holding only small coins spot, not leverage (few thousand to million+)
OBs: Should be buying consolidations
PSYCH: Don't leave your non-moving coin at support to jump risk-on to the big green candle
PSYCH: Biggest game-changer: Be comfortable (don't over-leverage going to bed, don't short pumping coins)

TIMEFRAME: He's mostly a day trader, 5m or 15m charts
SHIB: shib is indicative of the whole alt market
SHIB: Doge & Shib won't pump together coz they share liquidity

--
Twitch stream 211120
Bottoms form when people stop market selling, not when people market buys. Check gradients.
Ask if you took the trade 100 times, would it make money?

-- Twitch 211215
He doesn't like demands for trending alts, doesn't want to see the pump fully retracted
Hardly any V reversals, but mellow out / consolidate / gradient less steep
BNB always performs decently, binance is legit, should always hold BNB spot
Loma normally trades at H4 or H1
People that come up as good traders come from bear markets
Treat it like a video game, don't think about money value, it's a process (think of R). Risk 2% or 3% at a time. Make CONSISTANTLY good decisions.
Can use full candles or just bodies to mark his OBs (SHSLs)

PAIR-TRADE: Finding the pairs (narratives) makes it difficult

WICKS: Big wicks indicate emotion, ppl making irrational decsions
WICKS: Can only be so many sweeps of lows before failure (WW style)
CAPITULATION: Capitulation wick is like computer factory reset (OI goes, funding reset)
CAPITULATION: Big difference between capitualtion and continuous selling
S&P: S&P bounce to 4600 you should sell

PAIR-CHARTING: Two pairs duel combined coins tokens tradingview trading view cross pair conjoined twinned 
OBs: Too far back not good, buyers that created it won't be there
OBs: Use the freshest OBs, they're most significant
OBs: Unless there is big news that created the support / demand
INFO: Master the process then the money will come
INFO: Risk on when uptrending, risk off when downtrending

=====  Loma's Lounge Ep.7: RUSSIAN INTO POSITIONS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXcHN3aVCJ4
MS: Market structure is important but needs rest of the market to be good too (good MS for alt and BTC looks like shit useless) 

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.8: Bitcoin Decorrelates From Stonks?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoTpfFTd5CQ
BIG-CANDLE: The top of a big down candle will be strong resistance on the way back up; ie: stong supply zone
SL: Place SL above two levels of resistance (loma-put-SL-above-2-levels-of-resistance1.JPG)
SWEEP: Taking out highs (sweep) should be surgical and quick. There should be follow through down. Enter on follow through down with SL above the highs

===== 220311 Loma's Lounge Ep.11: FRIDAY SPECIAL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HizotFUkGgE
PUMPS: Big pumps with full retrace is BEARISH, lack of momentum
TIMEFRAMES: Establish H1 level (via D1) then goto 15m to refine
WEAKNESS: Mult pushes up, full retrace, then LH
WEAKNESS: see: TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM
SFP: SFP on multiple timeframes with follow through = strong signal = sfp confirmed
RSI: He doesn't use as other indicators will have already confirmed it by the time rsi confirms
LEADING: If recent leading coin is dumping, then whole market market will dump
WHALE: average whale ahs 20-40 million usd
EXIT: Whale exit pump = impulse up then immediate retrace
EXIT: Last squeeze, little coin in bear market, artificial
RETEST: not MS demands as this is full retrace
RETEST: Using SR levels (like CBS) better
RETEST: impulse, full retrace (to demand), weaker bounce (LH), then big dump well below demand
ENTRY: 10%, 20%, 20%, 50%

===== Loma's Lounge Ep.12: Return of the Bull?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEv3EaBe-h4

LOMA: About 1 hour in discusses Loma's method
LOMA: Execution expert

LOMA: Re-adds on dump
LOMA: Trades big size so has to slowly scale like this
LOMA: strength based on daily charts
LOMA: but more trades on lower timeframes for pumps / dumps
LOMA: range trading to build big position for nuke
LOMA: if nuke doesn't come he'll be OK since scaling in and out a lot
LOMA: If he posts daily chart basically need to scale in all the way between his entry and his stop
LOMA: This is how he can counter-trend trade successfully, large scaling in and derisking quickly, adding again to compound
LOMA: Great for learning to improve execution

Loma's Lounge: JULY 4TH WEEKEND 220702
FAVORITE: "Our favorite setup" (high, sweep, sweep, LH, LH)
FAVORITE: Atom example, short on the LHs
FAVORITE: Gradients showing waning momentum
FAVORITE: "loma-favorite-setup-sweep-sweep-LH-LH-short1-atom.png"
SZ: Loma uses SZ style (enter higher on reclaim on RH or lower on deviation of RL)
SZ: Consolidation above the highs (horizontal level) is good for a long
MS: Use HTF (daily) for market structure (not H4)
DEFENCE: Correct way to learn to trade is defensive strategy first, risk management
DEFENCE: Many make lots of money, but few can keep it (Su Zhu 9 billion in profits, but can't hold onto it)
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Visual test, pumps and pull backs
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Pumps get smaller and retraces gets deeper
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: First pump big wih shallow pullback, 2nd pump smaller with deeper pullback, 3rd pump smaller with bigger pullback
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: momentum is waning
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: Check this HTFs (H4 at least)
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: So his demand/supply is about momentum, not blocks
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: "loma-demand-supply-momentum-game-thoery-GMT-1.JPG"
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: (SF: check with RSI and AO)
TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM: game thoery of demand/supply, demand is decreasing supply increasing thus reducing momentum
TA: Just get 3/4 things that go "hand-in-hand", don't learn too much or you'll get conflicted; get good at execution
JOURNEY: The journey of a trader is to make money! Feelings, opinons, likes, DOES NOT MATTER, only go for best performing asset and squeeze the most money as possible from ut

===== https://youtu.be/pty51g4aOHU
LOMA: The After July 4th Special
SOL-PROXY: Sol, now determines the health of the alt market
SOL-PROXY: Sol, new-ish, large market cap
SOL-PROXY: Sol better than eth as proxy for alt-coin health now in Loma's opinion
INVALIDAION: At a pivot between a long and a short, take the trade with the easy invalidation
INVALIDATION: Like SZ, taking this trade because there's clear invalidation
INVALIDATION: Invalidation (SL) should be where we'd flip bias
INVALIDATION: Don't want to get stopped and have the same bias, means either (i) shit entry or (ii) risked too much
INVALIDATION: Think as a bi-directional trader
BEST-SETUPS: Good rule of thumb
BEST-SETUPS: The best long setups are failed short setups
BEST-SETUPS: The best short setups are failed long setups
BEST-SETUPS: "loma-best-long-setups-are-failed-short-setups1.JPG"
INVALIDATION-SZ: He's really like TraderSZ
INVALIDATION-SZ: EG: Short just below SR, short more at SR, short even more just above SR (assume deviation,invalidation VERY close now), close on long trigger of SR reclaimed as support
STAIRS-UP: Staircase up pattern never ends well
STAIRS-UP: stairs up, elevator down
STAIRS-UP: "loma-staircase-up-never-ends-well-elevator-down1.png"

"Loma's Lounge: Bear Market Rally or Reversal?"
MANY-SETUPS: "loma-BTC-levels-setups-nice-and-wide-likeSZ.jpg"
MANY-SETUPS: This stream shows exactly how he creates his setups; this is exactly how he does it
RANGE-DRAWING: can be drawn with rectangles (less accurate zones), don't need exact trend-lines
RANGE-DRAWING: Range EQ doesn't have to be exactly 50%, can use rectangle zone not quite at 50%
MAJORITY: Markets like to fuck with the majority
BUYBACK-WICK: Placing SL below a buyback wick is very good
POINT-OF-TA: Allows you to identify how prices act to certain levels and identify when you're wrong
POINT-OF-TA: THIS is what TA is for (not pretty drawn rectangles from candle etc)
POINT-OF-TA: If not doing this,may as well use market profile to just go with the flow of the market (long at trapped seller levels and short and trapped longer levels)
GAMING-COINS: Newer gaming coins are always better, HYPED!
GAMING-COINS: These are only as good as their last pump
LOW-LIQUIDITY: Low liquidity coins dangerous; difficult to get out without slippage of an extra 2-3% on your SL
PSYCH: If you're good to the game, it'll be good to you
PSYCH: HTF, makes a higher low, you might e scared, but you have to trust the PA (don't trust CT, articles)
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (1) study the charts, learn PA
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (2) Go and apply it
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (3) Need to do it yourself
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (4) sit your ass down and LEARN
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (5) Don't gamble
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (6) Lower position sizes
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (7) LEARN, skill development
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (8) The money will follow
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (9) Focus on the process, not the  results or money
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (10) Discipline and sacrifice, you need to sacrifice a lot to get good at this
PSYCH-HOW-TO-GET-VERY-GOOD: (11) Gave this spiel as folk are asking him for setups, and then getting rekt, because this is not what you're meant to be doing

WATCHLIST: Should be full of top performers and / or newer coins
TRADE-EXECUTION: Loma discussion 220811, Blacksphere
TRADE-EXECUTION: "Dynmaic position sizing with fixed risk"
TRADE-EXECUTION: Handling layered entries not filled
TRADE-EXECUTION: Adding to winning position
TRADE-EXECUTION: Dealing with layered entries giving full SLs but partial wins if not all entries hit on a winning trade
TRADE-EXECUTION: "loma-sizing-layered-entries-and-adding-blacksphere-7-mq-chart-example.JPG"

BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Loma execution style posted trades
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Loma catches BOUNCES first, not going for reversal
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Wide SL with layered weighted entries  (trying to catch wick right next to invalidation for biggest entry, but not always accomplished)
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: First TP usually less than 1R from first entry (BOUNCE catch)
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Second/third TP may aim for possible reversal
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: So high win-rate with lots of small winners (not all entries hit and only TP1 hit)
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Occasional home-run (all entries hit, huge position built right next to invalidation (very tight stop on the final biggest entry position))
BOUNCE-NOT-REVERSAL: Lots of small nibbles, occasional Michelin Starred meal

LAYERED-ENTRIES:
"loma-decreasing-exponential-entries1.JPG"
LAYERED-ENTRIES: These seem to have big initial entry then smaller extra entries (I presume layered, increasing size as it goes deeper into SL trying to catch wick)
LAYERED-ENTRIES: ..he norally says start small then add more and more, bigges add right next to invalidation, try for very very lucky entry

LOMA-SETUPS-RR: ...SL will be higher than entry quick
LOMA-SETUPS-RR: ...and (dynamic) R will be much higher now"
LOMA-SETUPS-RR: "I don't take trades SIGNIFICANTLY below 1R"
LOMA-SETUPS-RR: R is just a way to manipulate your trading strategies...
LOMA-SETUPS-RR: ...low winrate needs high R
LOMA-SETUPS-RR: ...high winrate only needs low R
LOMA-SETUPS-RR: You can only enter a trade with a base R

SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: why when prices go down to support do I get scared
SIT-YOURSELF-DOWN: why are you thinking like 80% of the market?

PUBLIC: Folk that share trades (CT) are
TOPS: want to see nice clean consolidation at resistance if it's to break
TOPS: this means it's obviously not nuking
TOPS: don't want to see pump, retrace, pump less retrace more, pump even less retrace even more (make LH too) see: "TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM"
TOPS: CBS also said today that increasing volatility is associated with tops forming (TRIPLE-DRIVE-DYING-MOMENTUM)
IMPULSE-CANDLES: Want to see them not get retraced; this is a sign of weakness (ie: their FVG should be support)
