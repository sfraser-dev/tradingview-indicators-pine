Loma — 27/04/2021
REALITY-CHECK: @everyone really quick a reality check before I drive to my cabin for the week:

REALITY-CHECK: Have patience.

REALITY-CHECK: We will have more and more of these 20-40% pullbacks on ALTs on the way up. It WILL happen. Your goal isn't to be an overnight financial success. The likelihoods of that are extremely thin.

REALITY-CHECK: What you're looking to do is this: 
- Compound gains consistently
- Don't lose money on those 20-40% pullbacks
- Make more money on the recovery

REALITY-CHECK: Don't get sucked into the poor man's situation. It's ironic because people want to be rich so they take on more risk which only keeps them poor.

REALITY-CHECK: Break free of that mentality. I know it's not very intuitive but you have to understand that risking more, betting big and other forms of improper management is how you actually stay broke in a bull market.
This is how you win.

REALITY-CHECK: You stack boring 5-10-15% bangers consistently and don't lose 50% of your portfolio when the market turns against you.
You take a small crack on the chin, maybe a 5-10% loss and then move forward.
There's NOTHING admirable about making 1m and then losing 900k on the dump.
I'd rather make 250k and lose 20k.
1. Less stressful
2. Proper risk management keeps you alive should the dump actually be the top.
You don't want to be one of those people that make millions in a bull market, have like 10x leverage and see it omega dump 30% only to liquidate your portfolio.
Think of it like boxing or MMA, you can have insane offensive capabilities but without defense, you're going to get exploited sooner or later.

The Market of Madness - Endless Range (with CBS)

D1: Large wicks are where liquidations have occurred (perhaps cascade liquidations)

EXEC-EXPERT: He always uses a hard stop
EXEC-EXPERT: Even if it's a huge SL for black swan protection, not really for trading
EXEC-EXPERT: Krill says Loma is an execution expert
EXEC-EXPERT: Chat said he has both discretionary and hard SLs, he rarely takes full 1R loss on a trade (cuts, adds, cuts, adds, adds, etc)
TRADES: He mostly plays SR flips
HTF-LEVELS: He uses Weekly & D3 to determine his bias to trade lower time-frames
PSYCH: CBS & Loma said hardest thing to do is get back in after being stopped out (instead of reversing bias)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: loma-slope-gradient-momentum.png
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling medium slope
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling steep slope (puts in bottom)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Selling tiny slope (rounded bottom)
GRADIENT-SLOPES: Momentum rounded out

Support and Resistance Workshop by "The Haven"
TA: SR = supply/demand = OBs = FTA = buy/sell walls
TA: Different names for the same concepts
TA: Loma uses swing high/lows SHSL
TA: Swing low: mark the low of the candle that gets swept
TA: Swing low: the sweep candle should go into an important area 
TA: What is support... just look at the chart (lies, choppy)
LIES: the chart / numbers do not lie
LIES: naratives lie, people lie, govs lie, 
LIES: lot harder to manipulate action than it is narratives
SLBE = Stop Loss to Break Even
CHOPPY-AREA: Choppy area = cluster
CHOPPY-AREA: Choppy areas = lot buying and selling & market participants
CHOPPY-AREA: up from chop = support
CHOPPY-AREA: down from chop = resistance
CHOPPY-AREA: support/demand, if price comes back, initial...
CHOPPY-AREA: ..buyers have TPd on way up & SLBE...
CHOPPY-AREA: ..don't bid the top of the demand zone
CHOPPY-AREA: DON'T BID THE TOP OF SUPPORT
CHOPPY-AREA: ..there will be wicks down to take the SLBEs
CHOPPY-AREA: ..will have been many buyers IN the choppy area
CHOPPY-AREA: ..demand is always a range...
CHOPPY-AREA: Martyn marks demand zone using Fib / OTE range
CHOPPY-AREA: bid 5%, 5%, 5%, 5%, down to 30% @ bottom
CHOPPY-AREA: SLBE at demand top TRIGGERS selling wick down
CHOPPY-AREA: psycology of people SLBE (profits have disappeared)
CHOPPY-AREA: someone is acting out of necessity and we just took their liquidity, we act on their demise, us and the exchange should be taking their money as they're liquidated, it's a zero sum game
CHOPPY-AREA: the more normal higher liquidity coins has more new traders who SLBE
CHOPPY-AREA: want to areas with lots of market participants (perhaps VOLUME (on HTF on liquid coins))
CHOPPY-AREA: downwards / upwards / sideways chop
LOMA-ZONE: marking the bottom of the choppy area!
LOMA-ZONE: Krill: "Loma nails his entries"
LOMA-ZONE: Loma's zones will be choppy
LOMA-ZONE: Lots of red candles in a chop, buy quick retest of this zone
ACTIVE-MPs: Active market participants
ACTIVE-MPs: This is where we want to buy
ACTIVE-MPs: The older the levels, the less they matter (participants will have TPd already)
ACTIVE-MPs: Lots of green candles in a row will have active participants TPing on the way up, moving their stops
ACTIVE-MPs: Look at recent levels, not "my 1.618 Fib"
RESISTANCE: Resistance in bull market is different to resistance in a bear market (not many participants)
Res: Support is a lot more common in a bull market (lots of touches of support)
RESISTANCE: Will usually have a big wick through the swing high resulting in Loma's SHSL resistance zone (wicks above but closes below; people (buyers) will be trapped here)
RESISTANCE: If price starts trading (opening and closing) above this SHSL resistance, then expect it to pump if bull market
RESISTANCE: He marks the wick tops at swing highs for resistance
RESISTANCE: When price travels to the highs but fails to close above, this is resistance
RESISTANCE: Trapped BO traders "please just let the price come back to near my entry and I will get out!"
RESISTANCE: You don't always need an OB, months/weeks of partcipants to tell the range
RESISTANCE: look for follow-through and go with that trend
RESISTANCE: You HAVE to be taking profits on the way up or you're just NGMI as a trader
RESISTANCE: resistance in bull market is normally formed by (i) people shorting (not so much this) (ii) people who bought then got trapped (much more this)
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: when drawing SR, keep in back of mind why it's there and build your own narative (eth 2.0 out, btc ATH pulled eth up, visa news, elon tweet tesla) - helps you understand the market
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Fundamentals drive techs in a bull market
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Put a narrative to things as it is reflected in the technicals
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Fold get in on FA news (tesla accepting btc) and this will create a TA level
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: He won't trade the charts on Uniswap as it's too easily manipulated due to low liquidity, no narrative
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: could be as simple as prior ATH
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: most of the money you make is going to come from average traders, you're not taking money from CZ, Sam, Bezos, Gates. etc
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Natural human reaction, hate losing, so move SLBE
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: He mostly bids the mid to low part of the choppy range
NARRATIVE&LEVELS: Put yourself into the shoes of a new, average or intermediate trader and ask "what are they feeling right now?", ecstasy, fear? What's the counterparty feeling?

Bottoms form when people stop market selling, not when people market buys. Check gradients.
Ask if you took the trade 100 times, would it make money?

-- Twitch 211215
He doesn't like demands for trending alts, doesn't want to see the pump fully retracted
Hardly any V reversals, but mellow out / consolidate / gradient less steep
BNB always performs decently, binance is legit, should always hold BNB spot
Loma normally trades at H4 or H1
People that come up as good traders come from bear markets
Treat it like a video game, don't think about money value, it's a process (think of R). Risk 2% or 3% at a time. Make CONSISTANTLY good decisions.
Can use full candles or just bodies to mark his OBs (SHSLs)

===== 220311 Loma's Lounge Ep.11: FRIDAY SPECIAL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HizotFUkGgE
PUMPS: Big pumps with full retrace is BEARISH, lack of momentum

Loma's Lounge: JULY 4TH WEEKEND 220702
FAVORITE: "Our favorite setup" (high, sweep, sweep, LH, LH)
FAVORITE: Atom example, short on the LHs
FAVORITE: Gradients showing waning momentum
FAVORITE: "loma-favorite-setup-sweep-sweep-LH-LH-short1-atom.png"
SZ: Loma uses SZ style (enter higher on reclaim on RH or lower on deviation of RL)
SZ: Consolidation above the highs (horizontal level) is good for a long
MS: Use HTF (daily) for market structure (not H4)
DEFENCE: Correct way to learn to trade is defensive strategy first, risk management
DEFENCE: Many make lots of money, but few can keep it (Su Zhu 9 billion in profits, but can't hold onto it)
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: Visual test, pumps and pull backs
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: Pumps get smaller and retraces gets deeper
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: First pump big wih shallow pullback, 2nd pump smaller with deeper pullback, 3rd pump smaller with bigger pullback
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: momentum is waning
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: Check this HTFs (H4 at least)
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: So his demand/supply is about momentum, not blocks
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: "loma-demand-supply-momentum-game-thoery-GMT-1.JPG"
DEMAND-SUPPLY-MOMENTUM: (SF: check with RSI and AO)
TA: Just get 3/4 things that go "hand-in-hand", don't learn too much or you'll get conflicted; get good at execution
JOURNEY: The journey of a trader is to make money! Feelings, opinons, likes, DOES NOT MATTER, only go for best performing asset and squeeze the most money as possible from ut

LOMA: The After July 4th Special
SOL-PROXY: Sol, now determines the health of the alt market
SOL-PROXY: Sol, new-ish, large market cap
SOL-PROXY: Sol better than eth as proxy for alt-coin health now in Loma's opinion
INVALIDAION: At a pivot between a long and a short, take the trade with the easy invalidation
INVALIDATION: Like SZ, taking this trade because there's clear invalidation
INVALIDATION: Invalidation (SL) should be where we'd flip bias
INVALIDATION: Don't want to get stopped and have the same bias, means either (i) shit entry or (ii) risked too much
INVALIDATION: Think as a bi-directional trader
BEST-SETUPS: Good rule of thumb
BEST-SETUPS: The best long setups are failed short setups
BEST-SETUPS: The best short setups are failed long setups
BEST-SETUPS: "loma-best-long-setups-are-failed-short-setups1.JPG"
INVALIDATION-SZ: He's really like TraderSZ
INVALIDATION-SZ: EG: Short just below SR, short more at SR, short even more just above SR (assume deviation,invalidation VERY close now), close on long trigger of SR reclaimed as support
STAIRS-UP: Staircase up pattern never ends well
STAIRS-UP: stairs up, elevator down
