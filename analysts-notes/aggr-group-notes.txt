SCALPER-VISION: CBS is worth 8-figures, he can afford to lose money
AVERAGE-JO: CBS has the higest beta of all the analysts

=== Time to get good, don't system hop
MQ: Info from latest Loma stream that I liked:
Took Loma 2 years to make money trading.
Didn't happen overnight, he was eating shit, ate less shit, became break even, then marginally profitable, then profitable, then the bull market came and he banged!
It happened gradually, but to others it looked like he did it overnight.
VISION: I'll add that 2 years is a rarity btw.
This is the hardest job in the world.. I would say 7+ years is probably average, unless you have a huge bank roll. That is if you're one of the 5% who make it.
Yeh most people do this game when they're retired.
In their 60's
key thing is to not system hop man. That is literally where you leak time.
