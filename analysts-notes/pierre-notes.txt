VIDEO-U-K-P: UB-Krill-Pierre-NYO-220913.pdf Wassie summary
PATTERN: H1-ma100 usually gives deadcat bounce, then taps H1-trend, then dumps to H1-ema200 textbook EMA pattern
===== Many MAs on one indicator (just use Krill's script instead)
INDICATOR: Name of the indicator: "Andre's 8EMA+8MA+BB+Ichimoku"
INDICATOR: here's the Youtube video he made back then to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=almTrFf3Q3c
INDICATOR: I'll share this in the last piece of my educational content!  All showed here on this chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/NiOAr20y/

===== Stoch info and using Stoch to adjust full risk
STOCH: My Stoch Notes from Web:
STOCH: Stoch RSI moves faster than RSI (from overbought to oversold)
STOCH: Stoch RSI is not good in choppy / range-bound market; too many false signals
TREND: Stoch is for trending coins
TREND: Pierre is trend trader only
TREND: says he's not good at ranges (MAs flat and getting chopped through)
CALC: Compare current RSI with LOWEST RSI in lookback
CALC: Scale this comparison by RSI range size
RISK-TRENDING: If price approach SR & trend from below and Stoch overbought (high) - go full risk short
RISK-TRENDING: If price approach SR & trend from above and Stoch oversold (low) - go full risk long
RISK-CHOP: If in stong downtrend and Stoch goes from oversold (low) to overbought (high) without claiming above SR / trend - full risk short
RISK-CHOP: If in stong uptrend and Stoch goes from overbought (high) to oversold (low) without claiming below SR / trend - full risk long
RISK: "pierre-stoch-usage-risk-adjust-aresgod1.JPG"

===== Pierre's simple methodology (in order of priority)
METHOD: Pierre's simple 3 point method:
METHOD: (1) Horizontal S/R flips and/or pivot 
METHOD: (2) Trend (13/25 EMA)
METHOD: (3) Stoch RSI at cycle low
METHOD: ---
METHOD: Ideally:
METHOD: Breaks above a horizontal SR
METHOD: Breaking this SR causes StochRSI into overbought (high)
METHOD: Consolidate above SR (TraderSZ) allowing trend to catch up (Krill trend-consolidation-pattern / "flag")
METHOD: "krill-trend-consolidation-pattern1.JPG"
METHOD: Consolidate above SR allowing StochRSI to reset
METHOD: Long to catch next leg up
CANDLES: He uses candle closes, not wicks, to mark SR levels
TREND-TRADER: Pierre is a trend trader, not good at ranges
TIMEFRAMES: He mostly just trades H4 and D1 (occasionally H1)
TIMEFRAMES: Krill: H4-ema200 and D1-ema13 are the GOATs

===== Pierre's Simple Trend System for going with Market Structure
METHOD: Pierre's simple 3 point method is designed to long on HH, HL, HH, HL structure, buying on a HL
METHOD: ---
METHOD: (A) Entering long on HL using horizontal and trend
METHOD: (i) Horizontal pulled from prev high ("must hold")
METHOD: (ii) If horizontal held, long will be a from HL
METHOD: (iii) Bullish trend (pointing up)
METHOD: (iv) trend retest buy will be a from a HL
METHOD: (v) Enter on the SECOND retest of horizontal & trend, NOT THE FIRST, let market structure establish itself first
METHOD: (B) Stoch used to help with timing (and risk adjustment)
METHOD: ---
METHOD: Horizontal and trend are designed so that the trade goes with the prevailing & established market structure & trend
METHOD-SUMMARY: Stoch is used to help with timing
METHOD: "pierre-trend-system-is-designed-to-long-on-bullish-MS-1.JPG"
METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: Krill: "Pierre nearly exclusively trades trend continuation patterns" (not trend reversal patterns)
METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: "krill-when-is-the-trend-reclaimed-continuation-or-reversal-1.JPG"

METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: Pierre is a H4/D1 trader who will try and compound his trades.
METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: Krill is a daytrader/scalper who tries to nail entries and TP along the way (doesn't compound).
METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: Krill uses compressions a lot (happen often on LTF) whereas Pierre just rides the H4-trend a lot..
METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: ..(not so many compressions on H4 or D1)
METHOD-KRILL-PIERRE-DIFFERENCE: "praise-from-pierre-for-explaining-his-system-1.png"
METHOD-COMPRESSION: Pierre uses H4-compressions between H4-trend and H4-macros (H4-ema200 and/or H4-ma100).. H4-trend-macro-banana
METHOD-COMPRESSION: ..doesn't seem to use other compressions (ma100, ema200 & ma300 on all TFs, Krill's original banana compression)..
METHOD-COMPRESSION: .. Krill also uses H4-trend-macro-banana too; but Pierre removed ma300 from his charts so no original banana comp for him.
METHOD-COMPRESSION: "pierre-compression1.jpg"

METHOD-COMPRESSION: "pierre-compression-trend-ma100-1.jpg"
METHOD-COMPRESSION: "pierre-H4trend-H4macro-compression-he-likes-1.png"

===== Education descibing his Trend/MA TA methodology again. keeps it simple
METHOD: Pierre: "I usually have 2 horizontals on my charts, a "must hold" and a "must break"
METHOD: Pierre: "I'm no market wizard or trading wizard, I'm a regular trend / swing trader"
METHOD: Pierre: "I keep my charts simple, and my setups simple too"
METHOD: "pierre-education-his-MA-system-explained-again.png"

===== Pierre use of MAs
MA-USAGE: Mostly uses trend EMAs (13, 25 & 32), not macro MAs
MA-USAGE: He uses MAs for bias (pointing up/down ([D]irection), MA [O]rder, steep/shallow ([G]radient), gaps between MAs ([G]aps)) - DOGG 
MA-USAGE-ACRONYM: DOGG (Direction (up/down), Order, Gradient (steep/shallow), Gaps) - DOGG
MA-USAGE: Macro MAs can be used for SLs and TPs
MA-USAGE: Krill: Can judge relative performance between cons on their ability to hold MAs (eg: coin X held H4-ma100 on the dump but coin Y didn't -
MA-USAGE: ..look for shorts on coin Y)
MA-USAGE: "pierre-stoch-usage-risk-adjust-aresgod3-sf-original-answer.JPG"

===== Pierre trend DEVIATIONS
TREND-DEVIATIONS: "pierre-trend-DEVIATION-using-stoch-and-SR.JPG"
--
SYSTEM-BULLISH-REVERSAL: SR reclaimed above
SYSTEM-BULLISH-REVERSAL: Trend EMAs need one previous successful retest (get in on second)
SYSTEM-BULLISH-REVERSAL: Stoch oversold (low, floored)
--
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: price peaks above the trend
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: Stoch oversold (low, floored)
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: first trend retest from above
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: cannot say SR fully reclaimed
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: system requirements for longing (trend reversal) not met
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: possibly just a trend deviation
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: (Loma: if the case for longing isn't valid, look to short)
--
UPTREND-STRENGTH: Stoch resets to oversold (low, floored) on retracement / "dump" without going below SR or below trend

===== Bias
D1-TREND-BIAS: Look at D1-trends (ema13, ema25 & ema32) to really help with bias
D1-TREND-BIAS: "pierre-above-below-D1trend-for-bias-4-good.JPG"

===== Compounding and trading philosophy 
COMPOUND: Pierre compounds a lot (H4 / D1 trader, low RR trades)
COMPOUND: Krill doesn't compound so much (scalper, high RR trades, tries to enter as close as possible to invalidation and TP on the way up)
COMPOUND: "krill-doesnt-really-compound-MA-theory101-2.JPG"

===== Folio increasing
FOLIO: "pierre-folio-increasing-month-on-month-SINGLE-SYSTEM.JPG"
FOLIO: He's using a single system. Trade management, goes heavy when system says to, sits on hands when no signal
FOLIO: Clear invalidations using his TA system, trade on this, don't know what direction trade will take, assymetric betting based on TA invalidations?

===== Begin GENERIC
TRADES-TAKEN: "pierre-if-setup-shared-entry-retested-assume-he-is-in.JPG"
TRADES-TAKEN: If he posts a setup and entry is tapped, assume he has taken it (220728)

COMPOUNDING: Bullish compounding on retests of taken highs
COMPOUNDING: "pierre-bullish-compound-plans-taken-highs-retested.JPG"

EMA200-MA100: Macro MAs are just noise reducers (no longer using ma200 or ma300 on his charts)
EMA200-MA100: Very common and popular MAs 
EMA200-MA100: play the gaps between them, break ma100 play gap to ema200
EMA200-MA100: HTF indicator of how market is moving, clean pivot/SR, use them as targets
EMA200-MA100: Horizontal levels more important than any MA in Pierre's system

TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: Keep longing the H4-trend until it's lost..
TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: ..once H4-trend lost, wait for (i) H4-trend to be reclaimed or (ii) D1-trend below..
TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: .. avoid the chop between H4-trend and D1-trend (Krill note: H1-ema200 should be between H4-trend and D1-trend)
TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: "pierre-play-H4trend-until-lost-then-wait-for-D1trend-avoid-chop1.png"

WHY-IS-TREND-EMA13-TO-EMA32: legacy from bots that were used on Huboi from 2019
WHY-IS-TREND-EMA13-TO-EMA32: "pierre-why-he-uses-ema-13-25-32-as-the-trend-is-legacy-of-old-huboi-bots.png"

MAJORS-ALTS-RELATIONSHIP-ROBOTIC-SYSTEM: BTC and ETH both below D1-trends
MAJORS-ALTS-RELATIONSHIP-ROBOTIC-SYSTEM: So look for alts bearishly retesting D1-trend with confluent horizontal SR resistance
MAJORS-ALTS-RELATIONSHIP-ROBOTIC-SYSTEM: "pierre-MA-system-robotic-BTC-below-D1-trend-look-to-short-alts1.png"
MAJORS-ALTS-RELATIONSHIP-ROBOTIC-SYSTEM: This is his robotic MA system (a bit like like JB's "secret sauce")

D1-TREND-FIRST-RETEST: Don't long first retest of D1-trend after a big move - likely to be lots of chop
D1-TREND-FIRST-RETEST: "pierre-dont-bid-first-test-of-daily-trend-on-big-move.png"

PIERRE-TREND-CASCADING-JUST-LIKE-KRILL: Trend dominos
PIERRE-TREND-CASCADING-JUST-LIKE-KRILL: H1-trend fails to H4-trend (fails to H1-ema200==D1-ema8) fails to D1-trend
PIERRE-TREND-CASCADING-JUST-LIKE-KRILL: "pierre-H1trend-to-H4trend-to-H1ema200-to-D1trend-cascading-just-like-krill.png"
PIERRE-TREND-CASCADING-JUST-LIKE-KRILL: "krill-ema200-and-trend-overlaps1.JPG - Shortcut.png"

LOMA-HORIZONTAL-LEVELS-RANGES-LIKE-PIERRE: Loma uses lines for where price will hover / range / cosolidate / CHOP; similar to Pierre
LOMA-HORIZONTAL-LEVELS-RANGES-LIKE-PIERRE: Pierre just uses these horizontals, he doesn't tend to use Loma / CBS / SR rectangles

SIMPLE-SYSTEM: An over simplification/explication of the basis of my system
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: D1-trending up below PA? H4-trend bullish below PA? Bid H4-trend retests from above.
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: D1-trending down? No longs.
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: D1-trending up? H4-trend is above price? WAIT for H4-trend to be reclaimed (or can play D1-trend retest from above)..
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: ..(or H1-ema200 (D1-ema8) just before D1-trend). 
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: D1-trend affects his bias.
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: H4-trend affects how he manages the position.
SIMPLE-SYSTEM: H4-trend getting chopped? Sit on hands.
SIMPLE-SYSTEM-EXTRA: NEVER bid D1-trend retest from above on 1st tap (often, this is a trap)
SIMPLE-SYSTEM-EXTRA: BETTER to bid H4-trend reclaims after a D1-trend retest from above - means most likely BUYING INTO MOMENTUM.
SIMPLE-SYSTEM-EXTRA-ALSO: If H4-trend getting chopped, needs consolidation period, no scalping (H1/H4 is a Pierre scalp!), keep focus on D1-trend
SIMPLE-SYSTEM-EXTRA-ALSO: Can be used with Loma consolidations (after an impulsive move - Loma horizontal lines)

MAs-CHANGE-WITH-TIME: MAs will move throught the day / week.
MAs-CHANGE-WITH-TIME: Price may not move much but the MAs may have changed character quite a bit (eg: krill's H1 consolidation pattern after impulse)
MAs-CHANGE-WITH-TIME: Got to let H4/D1 trades STEW for quite a few days / week(s)

H1-ANALYSIS-FOR-BTC: Trend cascade / dominos DOWN: H1-trend to H4-trend [to H1-ema200/D1-ema8] to D1-trend
H1-ANALYSIS-FOR-BTC: Trend cascade / dominos UP: D1-trend [to H1-ema200/D1-ema8] to H4-trend to H1-trend

KRILL-NOTES-MA-SWEEP: Pierre pointed out that MAs are like Price Action..
KRILL-NOTES-MA-SWEEP: ..compression of macro MAs, trend MAs dump below these (sweep / SFP) then near vertical after this
KRILL-NOTES-HTF-MA-GAPS: the stronger the trend, the bigger the gaps in the macro MAs

PIERRE-SPOT-BTC-POSITIONS-YELLOW-RED-BALL-STYLE: Use W1-trend for bias and D1-trend for managing position for long term spot positions (red/yellow ball)
PIERRE-SPOT-BTC-POSITIONS-YELLOW-RED-BALL-STYLE: A level deeper than his normal D1 for bias and H4 for managing the position
PIERRE-SPOT-BTC-POSITIONS-YELLOW-RED-BALL-STYLE: "pierre-spot-bags-his-system-yellow-red-ball-W1-bias-D1-entry.png"

PIERRE-HARD-AND-SOFT-TPs: He nearly always leaves some running to manually TP on loss of trend (usually H4-trend)
PIERRE-HARD-AND-SOFT-TPs: "pierre-hard-targets-but-leave-some-running-maual-TP-on-trend-loss.png"

SYSTEM-FORCES-PIERRE-TO-SHORT: if loss of H4-ema200 and below H4-trend (with D1-trend in bearish)
SYSTEM-FORCES-PIERRE-TO-SHORT: "pierre-system-forces-him-to-short-loss-of-H4trend-and-H4ema200.png"

LTF-TRENDS-DISRESPECTED-CHOP: If BTC LTF trends (H1-trend, H4-trend) disrespected, stay flat, heavy chop incoming, focus on D1 chart levels and D1-trend
LTF-TRENDS-DISRESPECTED-CHOP: If BTC LTF trends respected, Pierre would take about 10 BTC trades per week
LTF-TRENDS-DISRESPECTED-CHOP: "pierre-stop-scalping-H1-H4-if-trends-not-respected-or-10-BTC-per-week-if-trends-respected.png"
LTF-TRENDS-DISRESPECTED-CHOP: This is what trending should look like: "pierre-education-H4trend-retest-history-analysis-BTC.png"

EXECUTION-230303: Pierre layering entries, but going big on FIRST entry (75%)

GAP-FILL-TO-D1-TREND: lose bullish H4-trend, can play short to fill the bullish D1-trend below (with horizontal (and Stoch)) confluence
GAP-FILL-TO-D1-TREND: "pierre-gap-fill-lost-H4trend-down-to-FILL-D1trend-stx-1.png"

DUMP-AND-TREND-DISTANCE-AWAY: after impulse down, want to see LTF trends reclaimed relatively quickly..
DUMP-AND-TREND-DISTANCE-AWAY: ..for example, reclaim H1-trend, then gap up to H4-trend, reclaim H4-trend, then gap up to D1-trend
DUMP-AND-TREND-DISTANCE-AWAY: ..if they are not reclaimed quick, they get closer to price, meaning less chance of explosives moves up..
DUMP-AND-TREND-DISTANCE-AWAY: ..more chance of chop for a while then trend-continuation down (Krill H1-trend-continuation-strategy in reverse)
DUMP-AND-TREND-DISTANCE-AWAY: "pierre-level-to-level-trend-cascade-dominos.png"

NEWLY-LISTED-SHITCOINS: After first correction on newly listed shitcoins, long on first reclaim of their LTF trends
NEWLY-LISTED-SHITCOINS: "pierre-long-new-listed-shitcoins-on-LTF-trend-reclaims-after-first-correction.png"
NEWLY-LISTED-SHITCOINS: "pierre-standard-new-listing-long-PnD-then-break-H4downtrend-1.png"

BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: When D1-trend and H4-trend both bullish
BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: If H4-trend up lost, best to wait for bullsih retest of D1-trend below..
BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: ..AND RECLAIM of H4-trend up before longing, means buying into momentum
--
BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: When D1-trend and H4-trend both bearish
BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: If H4-trend down lost, best to wait for bearish retest of D1-trend above..
BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: ..AND RECLAIM of H4-trend down before shorting, means selling into momentum
BEST-LONGS-BEST-SHORTS: "pierre-want-H4trend-and-D1trend-both-reclaimed-to-long1.png"
===== End GENERIC

===== ***From Krill notes
KRILL-H4-TREND-LOSS: If H4-trend is lost, don't auto-bid H4-ema200 (D1-ema32), wait for H1-ema200 (D1-ema8) to catch up to H4-ema200 (D1-ema32)
KRILL-H4-TREND-LOSS: Pierre always says never bid 1st retest of D1-trend(32) (H4-ema200) from above, often a trap
KRILL-H4-TREND-LOSS: (MQ: wait also for H1-ema200 (D1-ema8) as well?)
KRILL-H4-TREND-LOSS: (So, H4-trend loss, don't blindly bid D1-trend from above, wait for D1-ema8 to be reclaimed too)
--
EMA200-AND-TREND-OVERLAPS: m15-ema200 = H4-ema13
EMA200-AND-TREND-OVERLAPS: H1-ema200  = D1-ema8
EMA200-AND-TREND-OVERLAPS: H4-ema200  = D1-ema32  
--
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: *** MAs are fractal: trend flip -> reversal mode (-> reversal reclaim) -> compression)
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: m15 is in REVERSAL RECLAIM or COMPRESSION
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: H1 is in REVERSAL MODE
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: H4 is TREND FLIPPING
--
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: REVERSAL MODE is flattening ema200 and curling up ma100 on the previous timeframe..
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: so if want to know if H4-trend has been reclaimed, check to see if H1 is in REVERSAL MODE
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: this is a simplier method to judge if a trend has been reclaimed
KRILL-TREND-FLIP-FRACTAL-METHOD: reversal mode is the precursor to reversal reclaim
--
KRILL-LAZY: Use H4 chart
KRILL-LAZY: short rainbow EMAs H4-ema13, H4-ema25, H4-ema34, H4-ema55, H4-ema100 (and H4-ma25)
KRILL-LAZY: short rainbow supercross (correct order) of FLAT H4-ema200 signifies incoming volatility
KRILL-LAZY: Pierre's MAs have the first three of the short rainbow EMAs so can kind of see it about to happen
KRILL-LAZY: Note: H4-ma25 == H1-ma100, H4-ema55 ~ H1ema200 -- are H1-ma100 & H1-ema200 in REVERSAL MODE?  

===== Pierre's gap fills & "reversal reclaim"
GAP-FILL: (1) flip the trend
GAP-FILL: (2) aim for ma100
GAP-FILL: (3) flip ma100
GAP-FILL: (4) aim for ema200

===== Trade plans for multiple coins using BTC / ETH for general market strength 
MQ overview of the following 9 points: Use BTC and ETH for general market bias (D1/H4 horizontals and MAs)
MQ overview of the following 9 points: choose alts that were (1) strong when BTC was weak (2) any narrative, eg: AI coins..
MQ overview of the following 9 points: ..(3) chose leaders of that narrative, not laggards
MQ overview of the following 9 points: build a plan for your trade (entry, invalidation, tps, risks)
MQ overview of the following 9 points: if you miss your altcoin entry, can dive into m15/H1 to catch entry (higher risk, needs more babysitting)
MQ overview of the following 9 points: "pierre-education-multiple-coins-trade-planning-based-on-BTC-1.png"

1) Take your #BTC and #ETH charts, clean everything on the chart, keep D1 trend, H4 trend, 200 EMA and 100 MA on it,

2) Highlight on both charts levels you consider as "crucial to defend for upside to remain valid", for both right now
   it's basically 23.1-23.3k and 1,600-1,620,
   => These levels are your invalidation on BTC and ETH and invalidation for your bullish bias on both (and therefore most likely on rest of the market)?

3) Make a list of alts you want to be focused on, try to not to spread too much, keep the list relatively short (max 5),

4) For these alts you want to be focused on: Alts that have been holding the best while BTC was shakey, alts that have ongoing
   narratives (even if really dumb, eg. AI narrative), alts that lead these narratives... Don't try to focus on laggards, this is
   environment for leaders right now.
   => You can use the alts i've been focus on as examples if you want... There's a reason i've been all over
   #INJ/USDT - SWING - H4 trend based entry #GMX-USDT _ D1-H4 Long #MASK [monitoring H4-trend retest and 3.4-3.6 region]
   #LRC/USDT - SCALP - H4 Long past few days... ;).

5) Same way than for BTC and ETH, highlight the D1/H4 trends and most important horizontal levels... Can be recent highs,
   can be ATH, can be last support retested... depends on the chart,

6) Based on these levels and confluence, you can start building trading plans, in current conditions most of the time they will look like this:
  - Entry = "As close as possible to H4/D1 trend retest in confluence with XXX horizontal level"
  - Invalidation = "On H4/D1 close below confluence of H4/D1 trend and XXX horizontal level"
  - Target #1 = "Recent highs"
  - Target #2 = "TBD"
  - Risk = Continuation setups, aggressive approach, risk must be adjusted

7) If you start seeing these shitcoins moving away too ... rapidly from your "ideal" entries...
   Then a solution is to dive into lower TF (usually H1/15 min). Or...
   To start again at 3) and find other setups...
   => It's important not to chase too much, this can backfire rapidly, especially if you're not an expert in scalping
   and don't have TIME AND/OR DISCIPLINE to manage/babysitt positions,
   => #MASK [monitoring H4 trend retest and 3.4-3.6 region] and #LRC/USDT - SCALP - H4 Long second scalp or
   latest #INJ/USDT - SWING - H4 trend based entry compounding entries on 15min/H1/H4 trend retests can be very good examples of diving into lower TF to chase entries.

8) Print baguettes.

9) It's forbidden to:
   - ask "should I exit"? NO! You don't enter if you don't have a trading plan. If you had a trading plan this question wouldn't exist.
   - ape in because you saw a random dumb thread on Twitter.. No - you build your own setups and trades.

Voilà... I wanted to close my day on this note because I know many might be sidelined right now and wondering what to do.

===== An over simplification/explication of the basis of my system (while answering a question in #member-questions) SIMPLE-SYSTEM: 
MQ overview of these 4 points: Is D1-trending up?
                               (i)  Yes - is H4 is trending up? Retest H4-trend from above (PRIMARY trade)
                               (ii) Yes - H4 isn't trending up? Reclaim above H4-trend (secondary) or wait for D1-trend retest (not 1st retest though)
MQ overview of these 4 points: *** D1-trend determines general bias, H4-trend determines trade management
MQ overview of these 4 points: if H4-trend getting chopped, sit on hands, focus on D1 chart
MQ overview of these 4 points: never bid first trend RECLAIM 
MQ overview of these 4 points: don't bid 1st retests of D1-trends, wait for D1-trend successful retest AND H4-trend RECLAIM (buying into momentum)
MQ overview of these 4 points: if H4-trend not being respected expect more consolidation. Sit on hands, focus on D1 chart, don't get chopped

The overall and OVERLY SIMPLIFIED approach I have is:
(1) - Is XXX is D1 uptrend?
      Yes -> Look primarily for long on H4 trend retests,
      No -> Don’t even think about longs.
   - Is XXX in H4 uptrending within D1 uptrend ?
     Yes -> Continue to chase longs on H4 trend retests as long as defended,
     No -> Wait for H4 uptrend to be reclaimed or D1 uptrend lower to be retested before considering adding/re entering ->
        (ie either play the gap fills lower, either wait for retests.)

(2) The D1-trend will affect my general bias toward XXX, the H4 trend will often affect how actively manage the position.

(3) I have a rule for when the H4 trend does NOT get respected (lost and reclaimed constantly), and it’s usually to stay the fuck out
and come back to a D1 focus until chart « reset » (ie H4-trend flat, H4 100 MA and H4 200 EMA at same value than H4 trend).

(4) So I have a set of additional rules:
    - I never bid a first trend retest after reclaim (ie I never bid D1 trend retest from above after a period of D1 downtrend for example,
      it often helps avoiding traps).
    - I always prefer bidding H4 trend reclaims than D1 trend retests (because once D1 trend retested and H4 trend reclaimed you have strength
      confirmations and are most likely buying into momentum [see early Jan H4 trend + H4 200 EMA reclaim on BTC, or even last week 21.8-22.0k
      reclaim to have an understanding of what I’m saying],
    - If H4 trend not respected most likely means asset needs consolidation period == most likely not interesting to actively scalp == stay focus
      on D1 trend and don’t get chop for nothing,

Don't hesitate to ask (I ask, then he doesn't answers, even with multiple bumps)
Re-entering profits (when compounding, but would never answer if just profits or capital + profits)
I'm an analyst, not a trader 
Took a small size trade, risky / scarey, because BTC
Sad for btc, sad.
Nothing has changed
Must read
Feels good
LMAO! Hahahaha! lol
Everything unfolding as imagined
What can I say
Yup
Nice bounce (for us)
And denied
Indeed
It's a shake
Ooof
That's one good battle
Congratulations everyone
Congrats (to everyone who got in trade even though entry wasn't hit)
What a banger trade
Banger
Good place to secure profits
Secure profits

EZPZ (easy peezy)
We've had a perfect day
It's super clean
Aaaaaaaaand once again denied
Hopefully we get answers to these questions (self-proclaimed / unelected spokesman for BTC and crypto)
Scary (enters long trade but "scary" as BTC at resistance, "be careful")
Takes a Loma trade (or CBS), then starts analysing after it's done well ("I'm also in")
Talk like he is BTC when it's doing well: "we've made a strong move up, great to see!"
"we've made a good move off H1-trend, GG to anyone that bid this (huge) area that I said might be important but didn't say to long it let alone provide a setup for it"
We're fighting to break
Can't wait to see what we get tomorrow
I mean.. (trails off as if he's the best analyst that has ever lived)
Gotta love to see it!
Manifest it
Homerun
What a week we've just had (market pumped, he made a little on trades, not great, co-opting market strength for making himslef look better)
Killer entry and great timing (by me! even if only a small size entry)
Close enough (copying SZ, but using "close enough" saying could be some chop over the weekend, draws dodgy range to so it was a bit choppy, I'm great)
Could get interesting
Teleport to target
Stacked weekend (weekend full of bangers)
Inverse moon-bag (holding a coin that is dumping - a small percentage of a "finished" trade that he'll actively manage with trailing SL (some MA))
GL HF (good luck have fun)
