VIDEO-U-K-P: UB-Krill-Pierre-NYO-220913.pdf Wassie summary
PATTERN: H1-ma100 usually gives deadcat bounce, then taps H1-trend, then dumps to H1-ema200 textbook EMA pattern
=== Many MAs on one indicator (just use Krill's script instead)
INDICATOR: Name of the indicator: "Andre's 8EMA+8MA+BB+Ichimoku"
INDICATOR: here's the Youtube video he made back then to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=almTrFf3Q3c
INDICATOR: I'll share this in the last piece of my educational content!  All showed here on this chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/NiOAr20y/

=== Stoch info and using Stoch to adjust full risk
STOCH: My Stoch Notes from Web:
STOCH: Stoch RSI moves faster than RSI (from overbought to oversold)
STOCH: Stoch RSI is not good in choppy / range-bound market; too many false signals
TREND: Stoch is for trending coins
TREND: Pierre is trend trader only
TREND: says he's not good at ranges (MAs flat and getting chopped through)
CALC: Compare current RSI with LOWEST RSI in lookback
CALC: Scale this comparison by RSI range size
RISK-TRENDING: If price approach SR & trend from below and Stoch overbought - go full risk short
RISK-TRENDING: If price approach SR & trend from above and Stoch oversold - go full risk long
RISK-CHOP: If in stong downtrend and Stoch goes from oversold to overbought without claiming above SR / trend - full risk short
RISK-CHOP: If in stong uptrend and Stoch goes from overbought to oversold without claiming below SR / trend - full risk long
RISK: "pierre-stoch-usage-risk-adjust-aresgod1.JPG"

=== Pierre's simple methodology (in order of priority)
METHOD: Pierre's simple 3 point method:
METHOD: (1) Horizontal S/R flips and/or pivot 
METHOD: (2) Trend (13/25 EMA)
METHOD: (3) Stoch RSI at cycle low
METHOD: ---
METHOD: Ideally:
METHOD: Breaks above a horizontal SR
METHOD: Breaking this SR causes StochRSI into overbought
METHOD: Consolidate above SR (TraderSZ) allowing trend to catch up (Krill trend-consolidation-pattern / "flag")
METHOD: "krill-trend-consolidation-pattern1.JPG"
METHOD: Consolidate above SR allowing StochRSI to reset
METHOD: Long to catch next leg up
CANDLES: He uses candle closes, not wicks, to mark SR levels
TREND-TRADER: Pierre is a trend trader, not good at ranges
TIMEFRAMES: He mostly just trades H4 and D1 (occasionally H1)
TIMEFRAMES: Krill: H4-ema200 and D1-ema13 are the GOATs

=== Pierre's Simple Trend System for going with MS
METHOD: Pierre's simple 3 point method is designed to long on HH, HL, HH, HL structure, buying on a HL
METHOD: ---
METHOD: (A) Entering long on HL using horizontal and trend
METHOD: (i) Horizontal pulled from prev high ("must hold")
METHOD: (ii) If horizontal held, long will be a from HL
METHOD: (iii) Bullish trend (pointing up)
METHOD: (iv) trend retest buy will be a from a HL
METHOD: (v) Enter on the SECOND retest of horizontal & trend, NOT THE FIRST, let market structure establish itself
METHOD: (B) Stoch used to help with timing (and risk adjustment)
METHOD: ---
METHOD: Horizontal and trend are designed so that the trade goes with the prevailing & established market structure & trend
METHOD-SUMMARY: Stoch is used to help with timing
METHOD: "pierre-trend-system-is-designed-to-long-on-bullish-MS-1.JPG"
METHOD: Krill: "Pierre nearly exclusively trades trend continuation patterns" (not trend reversal patterns)
METHOD: "krill-when-is-the-trend-reclaimed-continuation-or-reversal-1.JPG"

METHOD: Pierre is a H4/D1 trader who will try and compound his trades.
METHOD: Krill is a daytrader/scalper who tries to nail entries and TP along the way (doesn't compound).
METHOD: Krill uses compressions a lot (happen often on LTF) whereas Pierre just rides the H4-trend a lot (not so many compressions on H4)
METHOD: "praise-from-pierre-for-explaining-his-system-1.png"
METHOD-COMPRESSION: Pierre uses H4 compressions between H4-trend and H4-macros (H4-ema200 and/or H4-ma100).. H4-trend-macro-banana
METHOD-COMPRESSION: ..doesn't seem to use other compressions (ma100, ema200 & ma300 on all TFs, Krill's original banana compression)..
METHOD-COMPRESSION: .. Krill also uses H4-trend-macro-banana too; but Pierre removed ma300 from his charts so no original banana comp for him.

=== Pierre use of MAs
MA-USAGE: Mostly uses trend EMAs (13, 25 & 32), not macro MAs
MA-USAGE: He uses MAs for bias (pointing up/down, steep/shallow, gaps between MAs, MA order)
MA-USAGE: Macro MAs can be used for SLs and TPs
MA-USAGE: Krill: Can judge relative performance between cons on their ability to hold MAs (eg: coin X held H4-ma100 on the dump but coin B didn't - look for shorts on coin B)
MA-USAGE: "pierre-stoch-usage-risk-adjust-aresgod3-sf-original-answer.JPG"



=== Pierre trend DEVIATIONS
TREND-DEVIATIONS: "pierre-trend-DEVIATION-using-stoch-and-SR.JPG"
--
SYSTEM-BULLISH-REVERSAL: SR reclaimed above
SYSTEM-BULLISH-REVERSAL: Trend EMAs need one previous successful retest (get in on second)
SYSTEM-BULLISH-REVERSAL: Stoch floored
--
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: price peaks above the trend
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: Stoch floored
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: first trend retest from above
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: cannot say SR fully reclaimed
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: system requirements for longing (trend reversal) not met
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: possibly just a trend deviation
DEVIATION-DOWNTREND?: (Loma: if the case for longing isn't valid, look to short)
--
UPTREND-STRENGTH: Stoch resets to floored on retracement / "dump" without going below SR or below trend

=== Bias
D1-TREND-BIAS: Look at D1-trends (ema13, ema25 & ema32) to really help with bias
D1-TREND-BIAS: "pierre-above-below-D1trend-for-bias-4-good.JPG"

=== Compounding and trading philosophy 
COMPOUND: Pierre compounds a lot (H4 / D1 trader, low RR trades)
COMPOUND: Krill doesn't compound so much (scalper, high RR trades, tries to enter as close as possible to invalidation and TP on the way up)
COMPOUND: "krill-doesnt-really-compound-MA-theory101-2.JPG"

=== Folio increasing
FOLIO: "pierre-folio-increasing-month-on-month-SINGLE-SYSTEM.JPG"
FOLIO: He's using a single system. Trade management, goes heavy when systmem says to, sits on hands when no signal
FOLIO: Clear invalidations using his TA system, trade on this, don't know what direction trade will take, assymetric betting based on TA invalidations?

==== Begin GENERIC
TRADES-TAKEN: "pierre-if-setup-shared-entry-retested-assume-he-is-in.JPG"
TRADES-TAKEN: If he posts a setup and entry is tapped, assume he has taken it (220728)

COMPOUNDING: Bullish compounding on retests of taken highs
COMPOUNDING: "pierre-bullish-compound-plans-taken-highs-retested.JPG"

EMA200-MA100: Macro MAs are just noise reducers (no longer using ma200 or ma300 on his charts)
EMA200-MA100: Very common and popular MAs 
EMA200-MA100: play the gaps between them, break ma100 play gap to ema200
EMA200-MA100: HTF indicator of how market is moving, clean pivot/SR, use them as targets
EMA200-MA100: Horizontal levels more important than any MA in Pierre's system

TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: Keep longing the H4-trend until it's lost..
TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: ..once H4-trend lost, wait for (i) H4-trend to be reclaimed or (ii) D1-trend below..
TREND-TO-TREND-AVOID-CHOP: .. avoid the chop between H4-trend and D1-trend (Krill note: H1-ema200 should be between H4-trend and D1-trend)

===== TERMINOLOGY
All eyes on
Crucial
Curious to see
I'm extremely curious to see
To be honest
To be precise
Super curious
Super excited
Super comfy
Slaying the market
Let's see how it goes (what we get)
Can't be surprised
I insist 
Sit on my hands
As discussed previously (huge text walls citing every possibility)
As discussed and shared
As expected
Rode Sol last summer, amazing
Rode Luna to 3 figs, 
Must hold
Must break
Don't forget to pay yourself
Don't hesitate to take some profits
Don't hesitate to ask (I ask, then he doesn't answers, even with multiple bumps)
I'm an analyst, not a trader 
Took a small size trade, risky / scarey, because BTC
Sad for btc, sad.
Nothing has changed
Must read
Feels good
LMAO! Hahahaha! lol
What can I say
Yup
Nice bounce (for us)
And denied
Indeed
It's a shake
Ooof
That's one good battle
Congratulations everyone
Congrats (to everyone who got in trade even though entry wasn't hit)
What a banger trade
Good place to secure profits
Secure profits
Re-enter profits
Feels good
GG
Perfection
EZPZ (easy peezy)
We've had a perfect day
It's super clean
Aaaaaaaaand once again denied
Hopefully we get answers to these questions (unelected spokesman for crypto)
Scary (enters long trade but "scary" as BTC at resistance, "be careful")
Takes a Loma trade (or CBS), then starts analysing after it's done well ("I'm also in")
Talk like he is BTC when it's doing well: "we've made a strong move up, great to see!"
"we've made a good move off H1-trend, GG to anyone that bid this (huge) area that I said might be important but didn't say to long it let alone provide a setup for it"
We're fighting to break
Can't wait to see what we get tomorrow
I mean.. (trails off as if he's the best analyst that has ever lived)
Gotta love to see it!
Manifest it
Homerun
